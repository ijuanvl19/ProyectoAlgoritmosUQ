abstract = {The use of model membranes is currently part of the daily workflow for many biochemical and biophysical disciplines. These membranes are used to analyze the behavior of small substances, to simulate transport processes, to study the structure of macromolecules or for illustrative purposes. But, how can these membrane structures be generated? This mini review discusses a number of ways to obtain these structures. First, the problem will be formulated as the Membrane Packing Problem. It will be shown that the theoretical problem of placing proteins and lipids onto a membrane area differ significantly. Thus, two sub-problems will be defined and discussed. Then, different – partly historical – membrane modeling methods will be introduced. And finally, membrane modeling tools will be evaluated which are able to semi-automatically generate these model membranes and thus, drastically accelerate and simplify the membrane generation process. The mini review concludes with advice about which tool is appropriate for which application case.}

abstract = {Metaphor has had a prolific presence in sociology: as a subject of empirical study, as a tool for theorizing, and as ideas that live public lives beyond the ivory tower. Despite all this work, tracing the core dynamics of metaphors over time remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, I propose a systematic analysis of metaphor anchored around four core questions. What do metaphors describe? How do metaphors change over time? What do metaphors do? And how do conventional metaphors emerge? I address these questions in the context of one persistent and prolific metaphor: the network metaphor. To do so, I offer a formal model of the career of metaphor by drawing on cognitive linguistics and sociological theories of public ideas and professional careers. Specifically, I integrate the Google Books Ngram corpus with computational techniques that leverage co-occurrence to visualize and interpret the career of the network metaphor with respect to four areas: its jurisdiction, temporality, ecology, and conventionality. I leverage the network metaphor as both a revelatory case for evaluating my model and a critical case for deepening our historical understanding of the network. My analysis lends validation to the argument that the network metaphor has achieved the status of a broad category for thinking about contemporary life. However, it also demonstrates that the network metaphor had a lively history prior to the twentieth century. This includes significant changes in how it was used in the first half of the nineteenth century, a career standing in for anatomical structures of the body in the mid-nineteenth century, and a predominant expression in simile form prior to the start of the twentieth century.}

abstract = {Background
Effective shared decision-making between patients and physicians is crucial for enhancing health care quality and reducing medical errors. The literature shows that the absence of effective methods to facilitate shared decision-making can result in poor patient engagement and unfavorable decision outcomes.
Objective
In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Decision Description Language (CoDeL) to model shared decision-making between patients and physicians, offering a theoretical foundation for studying various shared decision scenarios.
Methods
CoDeL is based on an extension of the interaction protocol language of Lightweight Social Calculus. The language utilizes speech acts to represent the attitudes of shared decision-makers toward decision propositions, as well as their semantic relationships within dialogues. It supports interactive argumentation among decision makers by embedding clinical evidence into each segment of decision protocols. Furthermore, CoDeL enables personalized decision-making, allowing for the demonstration of characteristics such as persistence, critical thinking, and openness.
Results
The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of shared decision-making in the disease domain of atrial fibrillation. Our experimental results show that integrating the proposed language with GPT can further enhance its capabilities in interactive decision-making, improving interpretability.
Conclusions
The proposed novel CoDeL can enhance doctor-patient shared decision-making in a rational, personalized, and interpretable manner.}

The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.}

Thus, this quantitative study aimed to bridge this gap by assessing the proficiency of Thai Gen Z accountants in detecting accounting fraud, with a particular emphasis on their digital, data science, and diagnostic skills. The study collected data from 150 participants using a structured survey questionnaire distributed to licensed accountants affiliated with the Thailand accounting program. It adopted a theoretical framework inspired by social learning theory and information processing theory to examine both direct and mediated relationships among the key variables under investigation. The results were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine these relationships. The results showed that digital competency have significant direct effects on the fraud detection skills, with diagnostic skills playing a key role in the process. The study revealed that digital competency not only furnishes accountants with necessary technological expertise but also bolsters their analytical skills, which are vital for identifying fraudulent activities. Likewise, data science literacy—encompassing skills in predictive analytics, big data management, and data insight communication—significantly enhances accountants' capacity to identify and understand fraudulent patterns. The emergent role of diagnostic skills as a key intermediary emphasizes the importance of comprehensive training programs that foster both technical prowess and critical analytical thinking.}

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nonverbal thinking in man and elementary reasoning activity in animals and children. Verbal thinking is associated with the formation of a structural–functional organization of a pattern-code of verbal signals. Nonverbal thinking is associated with comprehension of the principles that make up the structural organization of environment. This type of thinking occurs in humans and other vertebrates. The chapter also discusses physiological and phenotypic aspects of nonverbal thinking. Both types of thinking have their own characteristics, which are related to the chemistry of the brain, and both reflect the nature of man. The main characteristic of nonverbal thinking is the success in performing the task at the first attempt. Repeated presentations of the task often lead to refusals to resolve it, the appearance of fear of the experimental conditions, and numerous signs of an overexcited state. A study described in the chapter revealed age to be a leading factor in determining the accurate understanding of object movement within the spatial–temporal coordinate system when the exact whereabouts of the object is unknown.}

For achieving our goal, items based on the PISA frameworks are developed, students in grades 5–8 from three different Russian regions are assessed, and three IRT models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) are applied to process the data. In addition, the correlations from the multidimensional model are estimated to examine the degree of cognitive specificity and mixture modeling is implemented to investigate ability differentiation across grades. Statistical analysis reveals that the bifactor model comprising one general and six specific factors, has a better fit in each grade. Based on this model, we compute the variance explained by the general factor, with the estimates varying between 60% and 70%. In general, the pure variance explained by specific factors does not exceed 10%. The correlations are above 0.40 in each grade and the averaged associations tend to increase from 6th to 8th grade, although they are smaller in years 6 and 7 compared to year 5. The general ability differentiation effect is observed in grades 6 to 8 and is not present in grade 5. Specific ability differentiation is more pronounced in reading literacy, especially in grade 5 to 7. The results obtained are discussed from the perspective of the ability and developmental differentiation/dedifferentiation problem.}

However, this property of multiplication is difficult for students to understand. We used two unique data sets to explore middle school students’ use of the distributive property. Study 1 involved data from 1:1 structured interviews of students (N = 24) discussing worked examples and solving associated practice problems. We examined whether or not students used the distributive property to solve the problems and whether or not interviewers followed the recommended distributive property prompts or defaulted to more conventional methods. Despite exposure to worked examples using the distributive property and a protocol calling for attention to it, students and interviewers favored methods like PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) or long multiplication. Study 2 used a data set with middle school students’ (N = 131) item-level responses on Kirkland’s (2022; doctoral dissertation, University of Notre Dame) Brief Assessment of Mature Number Sense along with several related measures of domain-general and domain-specific skills. We extracted problems involving the distributive property for analysis. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that students’ use of the distributive property improved from sixth grade to eighth grade. However, both grade-level mathematics achievement and cognitive reflection uniquely predicted the correct use of the distributive property. Results suggest that middle school students who exhibit stronger reflective thinking tend to perform better on distributive property problems. Findings highlight cognitive reflection as a potentially important construct involved in the understanding and use of the distributive property.}

Photos do not need to be false (altered or generated) to mislead; real photos can create a slanted representation or be repurposed from different events. Even semantically related non-probative photos, merely inserted to attract eyeballs, can increase message acceptance through increased fluency. Messages with images receive more attention and reach a wider audience. Text-congruent images can scaffold the comprehension of true and false claims and support the formation of correct and false memories. Standard laboratory procedures may underestimate the impact of images in natural media contexts: by drawing all participants' attention to a message that may be ignored without an image, they inflate message effects in the control condition. Misleading images are difficult to identify and their influence often remains outside of awareness, making it hard to curb their influence through critical-thinking interventions. Current concerns about deep fakes may reduce trust in all images, potentially limiting their power to mislead as well as inform. More research is needed to understand how knowing that an image is misleading influences inferences, impressions, and judgments beyond immediate assessments of the image's credibility.}

We trace the possible relations between his proto-connectionist notion of ‘organising’ machines in Turing (1948) on the one hand and his mathematical theory of morphogenesis in developmental biology (1952) on the other. These works were concerned with distinct fields of inquiry and followed distinct paradigms of biological theory, respectively postulating analogues of Darwinian selection in learning and mathematical laws of form in organic pattern formation. Still, these strands of Turing’s work are related, first, in terms of being amenable in principle to his (1936) computational method of modelling. Second, they are connected by Turing’s scattered speculations about the possible bearing of learning processes on the anatomy of the brain. We argue that these two theories form an unequal couple that, from different angles and in partial fashion, point towards cognition as a biological and embodied phenomenon while, for reasons inherent to Turing’s computational approach to modelling, not being capable of directly addressing it as such. We explore ways in which these two distinct-but-related theories could be more explicitly and systematically connected, using von Neumann’s contemporaneous and related work on Cellular Automata and more recent biomimetic approaches as a foil. We conclude that the nature of ‘initiative’ and the mode of material realisation are the key issues that decide on the possibility of intelligent machinery in Turing.}

One of the major computational challenges that online businesses face today is to make sense of huge amount of information. Granular computing has emerged as an important conceptual and computational paradigm of information processing. As an emerging field of study, it has been suggested that granular computing at philosophical level concerns with structural thinking and at the application level concerns with structured problem solving. It has been further suggested that fuzzy information granulation, as a special case of granular computing, is likely to play an important role in the evolution of fuzzy logic and may eventually have a far-reaching impact on its applications. Responding to the calls for future studies dealing with the applications of fuzzy information granulation, this paper presents an application of the theory of fuzzy information granulation in an emerging and important area where there has not yet been any application, showing how online sports services can make sense of huge amount of data in a structured way and how they can structure their decisions. The empirical results show that despite the huge amount of data that needs to be processed, fuzzy information granulation can help online sports services make sense of it and identify meaningful granules for easier decision making.}

An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes. However, schools are rarely able to use animated vignettes since existing tools do not allow them to be easily created and having them created externally is overly expensive. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool's multimedia features are often used and well-liked. Educators can download and use our tool while researchers can draw upon our design rationale and lessons learned when building similar tools.}

To investigate graduating nursing students' nursing and professional competencies and the predictors of their competencies.
Background
Across Asian countries, there is a paucity of literature that explores graduating nursing students' competency and professional competence during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Descriptive, cross-sectional, and predictive approaches.
Method
Convenience sampling was used among graduating nursing students from the six Asian countries (n = 375). The STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies were used. Two self-report instruments were utilized to collect data. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to assess the predictors of nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Results
Country of residence and general point average (GPA) showed statistically significant multivariate effects. Value-based nursing care and critical thinking and reasoning domains recorded the highest in professional competence and competency inventory for nursing students, respectively. Country of residence, GPA, and preferred nursing major were significant predictors of graduating nursing students' nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Conclusion
Our study's findings revealed a high level of diversity among nursing students regarding ethical care obligations, caring pedagogies, and lifelong learning, all of which may be ascribed to their distinct culture, background, and belief systems.}

abstract = {The Transient Reactor Analysis Code (TRAC), which features a two-fluid treatment of thermal-hydraulics, is designed to model transients in water reactors and related facilities. One of the major computational costs associated with TRAC and similar codes is calculating constitutive coefficients. Although the formulations for these coefficients are local, the costs are flow-regime- or data-dependent; i.e., the computations needed for a given spatial node often vary widely as a function of time. Consequently, a fixed, uniform assignment of nodes to parallel processors will result in degraded computational efficiency due to the poor load balancing. A standard method for treating data-dependent models on vector architectures has been to use gather operations (or indirect addressing) to sort the nodes into subsets that (temporarily) share a common computational model. However, this method is not effective on distributed memory data parallel architectures, where indirect addressing involves expensive communication overhead. Another serious problem with this method involves software engineering challenges in the areas of maintainability and extensibility. For example, an implementation that was hand-tuned to achieve good computational efficiency would have to be rewritten whenever the decision tree governing the sorting was modified. Using an example based on the calculation of the wall-to-liquid and wall-to-vapor heat-transfer coefficients for three nonboiling flow regimes, we describe how the use of the Fortran 90 WHERE construct and automatic inlining of functions can be used to ameliorate this problem while improving both efficiency and software engineering. Unfortunately, a general automatic solution to the load-balancing problem associated with data-dependent computations is not yet available for massively parallel architectures. We discuss why developers should either wait for such solutions or consider alternative numerical algorithms, such as a neural network representation, that do not exhibit load-balancing problems.}

While various approaches, such as energy systems analysis and linear or non-linear optimisation, have been employed to achieve energy sustainability mainly at the national or city level, there has been a lack of focus on achieving energy sustainability in the residential sector through a holistic optimal decision-making approach for efficient HES design. This study focuses on developing a multi-stage optimisation-based decision-making framework that models, quantifies, and optimises the performance indicators of HES, allowing for an assessment of the trade-off between benefits and systems costs under various design scenarios. The initial step involves designing the HES model and constructing scenarios that cater to the electrification requirements of water, energy, and food elements in the residential sector by using a systematic thinking approach. Then, a preliminary evaluation of the modelled scenarios is conducted to assess energy sustainability in terms of technical and economic aspects. Afterwards, an optimal decision-making setup is established by integrating a multi-objective HES model into the NSGA-II algorithm, which approximates the Pareto optimal solutions. These solutions are then ranked by using a multi-criteria decision-making method. According to the findings, the Quetta region in Pakistan contains the best optimal solution. The results underscore the utility of the developed framework in facilitating the optimal design of renewables-integrated HES for the residential sector. Furthermore, intergovernmental organizations can leverage this framework to formulate effective policies aimed at encouraging residents to invest in HES installation.}

The novelty lies in the introduction of a new concept for approximate reasoning processes based on granular computations. Although many rough set theory extensions developed over time focus on reasoning about (partial) set inclusion, these approximation spaces sometimes fall short when dealing with crucial aspects of approximate reasoning within ISs. Specifically, these systems aim to construct high-quality approximations of compound decision granules that represent solutions. Here, we present the basis for insightful reasoning realized through approximate reasoning processes grounded in granular computations. By doing so, we provide a sufficiently rich basis for designing IS problem solvers. This basis allows ISs to restructure or adapt their reasoning based on the generated granular computations, ultimately leading to high-quality granular solutions.}

This article focuses on the theory and practice underpinning our use of Nuprl for much of the last decade. We discuss innovative elements of type theory, including new type constructors such as unions and dependent intersections, our theory of classes, and our theory of event structures. We also discuss the innovative architecture of Nuprl as a distributed system and as a transactional database of formal mathematics using the notion of abstract object identifiers. The database has led to an independent project called the Formal Digital Library, FDL, now used as a repository for Nuprl results as well as selected results from HOL, MetaPRL, and PVS. We discuss Howe's set theoretic semantics that is used to relate such disparate theories and systems as those represented by these provers.}

abstract = {We consider a class of Kuramoto models, with an array of N individual k-dimensional clocks (k>1), coupled within a directed, range dependent, network. For each directed connection, a signal triggered at the sending clock incurs a (real valued) time delay before arriving at the receiving clock, where it induces an instantaneous phase reset affecting all k-phases. Instantaneous phase resetting maps (PRMs) for k-dimensional clocks have received little attention. The system may be treated as open and subject to periodic, or other types of, PRM forcing at any individual clock, as a result of external forcing stimuli. We show how the full system, with Nk phase variables, responds to such stimuli, as the impact spreads across the entire network. Beyond simulations, we employ methods to reverse engineer the dynamical behaviour of the whole: estimating the intrinsic dimensions of the responses to different experiments; and by analysing pairwise comparisons between those responses. This shows that the system’s responses are governed by a hierarchy of internal dynamical modes, existing across both the Nk phases and over time. We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each k-dimensional clock models the dynamics of a single neural column, which contains 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons. The Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. An array of N=1M such columns/clocks is at the 10B neuron scale of the human cortex. However its simulation is far more accessible than very large scale (VLS) simulations of neuron-to-neuron systems on supercomputers. The latent modes may have important implications for cognition (information processing) and for consciousness (the existence of internal phenomenological experiences). We argue that the existence of the latter plays a key role in preconditioning the former, reducing the decision sets and the cognitive load, and thus enabling a fast-thinking evolutionary advantage. This is the first time that systems of k-dimensional clocks (k> 1), coupled via time-lagged PRMs, within range dependent networks, have been deployed to demonstrate the basic internal phenomenological elements (of consciousness) and their potential role within immediate cognition. Statement of Significance: We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each of 1M k-dimensional clocks models the dynamics of a single neural column (containing 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons). This Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. Large scale human cortex simulations, with 10B neutrons, usually require a super computer. We show that similar results, using this model, can be obtained on a laptop. In particular we show that such dynamical can support internal phenomenological elements (of conscious experience) and we discuss their potential role in preconditioning immediate cognition, furnishing a “fast thinking” evolutionary advantage to the human brain.}

At the point when this heat isn't appropriately disseminated, the engine gets more fragile very soon and life of the engine declines because of the heat development. To build the life of the engine, heat dispersal is expanded by giving fins at external of engine chamber. The shape of the fins and the material used for the fin increases its heat dissipation capacity and in turn increases the cooling of the engine for proper functioning. The present work focuses on the design of fins of circular and tapered shapes for a 2-stroke engine. The temperature distribution and the heat dissipation along the fin surface of two shapes has been observed by a steady state thermal analysis. Alusil and Silumin has been selected as the fin materials and a computational evaluation has also been done using FEM. A better shape of the fin along with a suitable material has been selected based on the results observed by FEM and on comparison with the existing shape and material of the fin.}

Specifically, we show that activation maps generated during such cognitive process were precisely located relative to borders of well-known networks such as internal speech, visual and motor imagery. The activation patterns allowed decoding the thought condition at >95%. Surprisingly, the activated networks remained the same regardless of changes in thought content. Finally, we found remarkably consistent activation maps across individuals engaged in abstract thinking. This activation bordered, but strictly avoided visual and motor networks. On the other hand, it overlapped with left lateralized language networks. Activation of the default mode network (DMN) during abstract thought was similar to DMN activation during rest. These observations were supported by a quantitative neuronal distance metric analysis. Our results reveal that despite its high level, and varied content nature - abstract thinking activates surprisingly precise and consistent networks in participants’ brains.}

By conducting DFT calculations, we can analyze how NMs will behave across different mechanical states, which is critical for designing properties for advanced applications. Problems related to the application of DFT (e.g., high computational cost and failure in modeling defects or exchange-correlation functionals) are discussed. Despite these challenges, DFT must provide insights that complement other tools and strategies. However, further development is essential for improving its quantitative predictability on temperature and multiscale models. Future work is needed to integrate ML with DFT further to refine the accuracy and computational efficiency, thereby extending the capability of DFT to accelerate the discovery of new NMs with superior mechanical properties.}

We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis.

For some parameter values, sophisticated predators are able to reason their way to the Nash equilibrium strategy, and prices do not oscillate.

We investigated GA strategies during face-to-face social style interactions with familiar and unfamiliar interlocutors. Participants with WS and ASD used overall typical amounts/patterns of GA with all participants looking away most while thinking and remembering (in contrast to listening and speaking). However there were a couple of specific disorder related differences: participants with WS looked away less when thinking and interacting with unfamiliar interlocutors; in typical development and WS familiarity was associated with reduced gaze aversion, however no such difference was evident in ASD. Results inform typical/atypical social and cognitive phenotypes. We conclude that gaze aversion serves some common functions in typical and atypical development in terms of managing the cognitive and social load of interactions. There are some specific idiosyncracies associated with managing familiarity in ASD and WS with elevated sociability with unfamiliar others in WS and a lack of differentiation to interlocutor familiarity in ASD. Regardless of the familiarity of the interlocutor, GA is associated with thinking for typically developing as well as atypically developing groups. Social skills training must take this into account.}

abstract = {Studying large complex problems that often arise in computational stochastic dynamics (CSD) demands significant computer power and data storage. Parallel processing can help meet these requirements by exploiting the computational and storage capabilities of multiprocessing computational environments. The challenge is to develop parallel algorithms and computational strategies that can take full advantage of parallel machines. This paper reviews some of the characteristics of parallel computing and the techniques used to parallelize computational algorithms in CSD. The characteristics of parallel processor environments are discussed, including parallelization through the use of message passing and parallelizing compilers. Several applications of parallel processing in CSD are then developed: solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation, Monte Carlo simulation of dynamical systems, and random eigenvector problems. In these examples, parallel processing is seen to be a promising approach through which to resolve some of the computational issues pertinent to CSD.}

abstract = {This text discusses today’s digital transformation through the lens of Horkheimer and Adornos’ study of the enlightenment. Policy and public discourse around digitalisation embrace and adhere to the narrow tenets enlightenment thinking; the idea that rationality, individual freedom, and a society free from superstition are necessary and attainable goals. The costs of what has come to be called ‘Modernity’ are many. Through the application of rationality to all spheres of life, married with disruptive technological advancement, humanity has diminished its’ imagination – its ability to seek new directions. To paraphrase Horkheimer and Adorno, Modernism fights against nature, of which we are a part, and thus, paradoxically, sets us in a fight against ourselves. Environmental degradation, the price of progress, being just one example of this – deadening work, consumerism and severed social connections being amongst others. In this framing, digitalisation itself comes to be understood itself as akin to a force of nature – one that we can do little about, other than adjust and adapt or be swept away. But this by no means a foregone conclusion, there is light at the end of the optical fibre. Albeit that recent technical developments around artificial intelligence appears to be pushing policy makers into hasty decisions, the pace of the technical development is not as fast as we believe, and in comparison with the Reformation – we have time. If we can restrain ourselves from the resist, adapt or die responses promoted in popular discourse in face of the shock of large language models and rising threat of automation, then we create room to consider economic, social, and ecological alignment and accord, in the decision making and design of future interactive artefacts and digital services. The article argues that through postdigital aesthetics, technology makers can embrace materiality and the inherent qualities of digital technology to formulate a critique of existing trajectories in digital transformation, with consequences for a more sustainable future.}

Central to this paper is a reformulation in terms of matrix arithmetic of the original ripple effect algorithm produced by Yau and Collofello in 1978. The main aim of the reformulation is to clarify the component parts of the algorithm making the calculation more explicit. The reformulated algorithm has been used to implement REST (Ripple Effect and Stability Tool) which produces ripple effect measures for C programs. This paper describes the reformulation of Yau and Collofello’s ripple effect algorithm focusing on the computation of matrix Zm which holds intramodule change propagation information. The reformulation of the ripple effect algorithm is validated using fifteen programs which have been grouped by type. Due to the approximation spurious 1s are contained within matrix Zm. It is discussed whether this has an impact on the accuracy of the reformulated algorithm. The conclusion of this research is that the approximated algorithm is valid and as such can replace Yau and Collofello’s original algorithm.}

Within the DIM paradigm, the input cognitive systems are not domain specific or core-knowledge specific, they are operational specific and capable of further developments that become domain specific while experiencing the environment. Arguments for this construal come from three sources: literature review, data collected through classroom observations, and a four-year experimental study of teaching and learning mathematics in primary grades. The outcomes of that experiment led to a methodology of learning based on activating the operational infrastructure of mind, which enhances students' flexibility of thinking and predicts the capacity to solve creatively a variety of problems.}

The veracity of such prospective action judgements, and the mechanisms by which they are computed, was explored in a series of tasks that involved either grasping (MC conditions) or thinking about grasping (PJ conditions) a dowel presented in various orientations. PJs concerning limits of comfortable hand supination and pronation when turning a dowel in the picture plane were highly consistent with values obtained during actual hand rotation (Exp. 1). The same was true for judgements regarding the level of awkwardness involved in adopting a prescribed grip (e.g. overhand with right hand) for dowels in various picture plane orientations (Exp. 2). When allowed to select the most natural grip (overhand versus underhand) or hand (left versus right) for engaging dowels in these orientations, subjects preferred virtually identical responses in both PJ and MC conditions. In both instances, they consistently chose the least awkward response options. As would be expected for actual movements, PJs involving awkward hand postures had longer response times (RTs), and were less accurate. Likewise, latencies for both grip and hand judgements tended to increase as a function of the angular distance between the current positions of subjects’ hands, and the orientation of the chosen posture. Together, these findings are consistent with a the hypothesis that PJs involve mentally simulated actions, or motor imagery. These results suggest that motor imagery does not depend on the existence of a completed premotor plan (Jeannerod, 1994), but may instead be involved in the planning process itself. A provisional model for the involvement of imagery in motor planning is outlined, as are a set of criteria for evaluating claims of the involvement of motor imagery in problem solving.}

This introductory chapter discusses the main issues associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the prospect of a machine that could think. AI is the study of intelligent behavior that is achieved through computational means. One striking aspect of intelligent behavior is that it is conditioned by knowledge. Knowledge representation and reasoning are the parts of AI that are concerned with how an agent uses what it knows in deciding what to do. It is the study of thinking as a computational process. The book introduces the symbolic structures invented for representing knowledge and the computational processes devised for reasoning with those symbolic structures. The reason why logic is relevant to knowledge representation and reasoning is that logic is the study of entailment relations—languages, truth conditions, and rules of inference… Despite the centrality of knowledge representation and reasoning to AI, there are alternate views. Some authors have claimed that human-level reasoning is not achievable via purely computational means. Others suggest that intelligence derives from computational mechanisms.}

However, this approach fails to give a comprehensive account of each inputs' relevance, since simultaneous perturbations in two or more parameters often entail higher-order effects that cannot be captured by an OAT analysis. We propose to conduct global variance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby n parameters are viewed as uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works by encoding the uncertainties as n additional variables of the network. To prevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use low-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller factors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain n global sensitivity indices, one for each parameter of interest. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited and learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can significantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of uncertain parameters and their interactions.}

Firstly, a time field change criterion is established based on the variation of phase field variable and its increment, so that the pseudo time increment and load increment can be adaptively regulated with the solution of displacement and phase fields, which cuts down on computation time and the number of iterations. Secondly, the implementation of the scheme is introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed solution scheme is tested through some numerical examples. The results showcase that the proposed strategy can not only acquire accurate load–displacement responses and crack patterns, but also significantly reduce the computational cost. By comparing with the current standard staggered strategy and the monolithic BFGS strategy, the computation time of the presented solution scheme is about 1% of that of the standard strategy, and less than 1/3 of the time of the BFGS strategy. Meanwhile, the presented scheme also exhibits excellent convergence properties.}

This paper describes the development of a method that integrates input-output (IO) table flows with SD modelling to improve the completeness of UM assessments. This modelling framework can also allow for a ‘nested’ multi-region assessment which takes into account sustainability burdens consequent to urban system changes occurring elsewhere in the national and/or global economy. Pros and cons of this proposal are showcased by the illustration of a model for Lisbon.}

Conditional probabilities and Entropy analyses were used to examine nuanced patterns manifested in students’ interaction choices within a computer-based learning environment. Forty high school students interacted with the game-based intelligent tutoring system iSTART-ME, for a total of 11 sessions (pretest, 8 training sessions, posttest, and a delayed retention test). Results revealed that high and low reading ability students differed in their patterns of interactions and the amount of control they exhibited within the game-based system. However, these differences converged overtime along with differences in students’ performance within iSTART-ME.

Forests have historically not been perceived as interconnected networks of trees; recently however, researchers have described the “wood-wide web” in which underground fungi interconnect large numbers of trees and plants via chemical and electrical signals. Some of earth’s forests number many billions of trees, and some of the world’s prairies and seagrass meadows also contain billions of individual plants. These plant ecosystems may thus be self-aware, and in fact there may be a multitude of self-aware plant-based ecosystems on earth already. The speed of signal transmission via fungi within each ecosystem is much slower than that in humans, and therefore their organismal self-awareness may be of a different nature than the self-awareness that we associate with humans and upper primates. However, the possibility that our plant systems may be aware of the environmental insults that are being wrought upon them should make us reconsider our anthropocentric activities, as well as the possibility that humanity may need to collaborate with other intelligent non-human earth-based life forms to ensure mutual survival.}

KCaBi, as a high-throughput screening semiconductor with ultralow κl [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 144, 4448 (2022)], has been demonstrated that the contribution of optical phonons plays an important role in thermal transport. In this work, by solving the Boltzmann transport equation, it is found that the κl of KCaBi is 2.2 at 300K, with acoustic phonons dominating the z-direction κl and optical phonons contributing around 50% to the x-direction κl under the four-phonon picture. The uncommon contribution of optical phonons also manifests the possibility of tuning the κl anisotropy based on optical phonons. Following this line of thinking, it is found that applying tensile strain can cause a more pronounced decrease of acoustic phonon contribution than that of optical counterpart due to the highly dispersive optical branches, thus enhancing the anisotropic ratio of κl. Moreover, the microscopic mechanism is elucidated by analyzing the phonon dispersion relation, phonon mode-wise contribution and phonon scattering rates. Our study could provide appealing alternatives for the regulation of phonon transport from the viewpoint of optical phonons.}

BEXs are critical for building brand loyalty (BL) and making companies profitable. Customers can experience different kinds of brand experiences through feeling, emotions, affection, behavior, and intellect. The present research work is taken up to analyze the factors affecting BEX and its impact on BL and BE of the OFDPs and analyze the mediating role of BL in the relationship between BEX and BE of the OFDPs in the Indian context. A survey of 457 Indian customers was carried out. A questionnaire was used for data collection and a mediation study was used to test hypothesized relationships. Our computational analysis reveals that BEX influences the BL and BE of OFDPs. The study further indicates that BL mediates the relationship between BEX and BE of OFDPs. The effective marketing and relationship management practices will help company to enhance BEX that will enable in enhancing BL and raising BE of their product. It therefore provides a more thorough analysis of BEX constructs and their consequences than previous research.

While previous studies have extensively examined various influencing factors, they often neglect the impact of behavioral inertia. To address this gap, this study conducts a behavioral experiment to quantitatively assess the presence and impact of behavioral inertia on residents' governance and financial participation behaviors. A total of 576 valid survey questionnaires were collected, and conditional logit model and ordered logit model were utilized for analysis. The study reveals that behavioral inertia is indeed observable in residents' governance participation and financial participation behaviors. Furthermore, the findings underscore distinct drivers of behavioral inertia for these two types of participation behaviors, with emotional reactions predominantly influencing governance participation, while short-term thinking largely shapes financial participation. Theoretically, this study uses the innovative concept of “behavioral inertia” to offer a new explanatory framework for aspects of behavior that cannot be solely explained by the attributes of regeneration plans. Furthermore, the behavioral experiments utilized in this study exemplify how the research framework of behavioral science can be applied to the study of urban governance in a broad context internationally. Practically, the research findings provide valuable insights for urban policymakers to tailor measures aimed at promoting resident participation and fostering sustainable urban development.}

Meanwhile, videos become mainstream in the advertisement realm. To expand the scope of research from journalism to advertisement, from text news to video, a comparative study was conducted to examine how the users perceive the video created by AI and humans. There is no significant difference explicitly, but the implicit appraisals were in favor of human-generated video. The key discussion is the boundary thinking of AI in both the academic and industrial spheres.}

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.}

We review evidence supporting cognitive maps and image spaces, and we propose a hippocampal–parietal network that can account for the organization and retrieval of knowledge across multiple reference frames. We also suggest that cognitive maps and image spaces may be two manifestations of a more general propensity of the mind to create low-dimensional internal models.}

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.}

Such online research, though well-suited to qualitative analysis, leads to a number of practical problems in terms of range, depth, and ease of access to data. Even extensive data collection and manual analysis often only engage with a small percentage of the data available in online communities. In this article, we present a traditional manual collection and thematic analysis of data (2631 posts across 60 different threads, approximately 300,000 words) from forums where sex workers and men who pay for sex discuss matters relating to prostitution. This analysis revealed five themes of forum use: preference sharing, personal narrative sharing, practical advice, philosophical issues, and community maintenance. Further automated data collection and corpus analysis, such as keyness and topic modelling, are presented as a potential innovation within online qualitative research. This approach allowed for the analysis of a larger dataset of 255,891 posts, across 14,232 threads (16,472,006 words), revealing additional themes such as sexual hygiene, desire, legality, and ethnicity, as well as differences in the use of terms of address and slang by punters and sex workers. The automated methods presented allow for more comprehensive investigations of online communities than traditional approaches, but we also note that manual interpretation should still be incorporated into the analysis.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance.
Objective
This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society.
Methods
Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy.
Results
A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001).
Conclusions
The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.}

The fusion of AI with applications such as machine learning, deep-learning, and even computational modeling allows for the real-time tracking and enhancement of biological processes within the body. An exemplary application of AI is the use of DeepMind's AlphaFold to design new GABA reuptake inhibitors for epilepsy and anxiety. Likewise, Benevolent AI and IBM Watson have fast-tracked drug repositioning for neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, we identified new serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression through AI screening. In addition, the application of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings using AI for patients with Parkinson's disease and for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using reinforcement learning-based transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) leads to better treatment. This review highlights other challenges including algorithm bias, ethical concerns, and limited clinical validation. Their proposal to incorporate AI with optogenetics, CRISPR, neuroprosthesis, and other advanced technologies fosters further exploration and refinement of precision neurotherapeutic approaches. By bridging computational neuroscience with clinical applications, AI has the potential to revolutionize neuropharmacology and improve patient-specific treatment strategies. We addressed critical challenges, such as algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, by proposing bias auditing, diverse datasets, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks as practical solutions to ensure equitable and transparent AI applications in neurotransmitter modulation.}

It also reviews the range of critical indicators for CDWM performance assessment considered by the literature and put forwards a new framework for better assessing CDWM performance. The proposed framework summarises the system boundary, research scale and performance assessment aspects documented by previous studies, and further integrate an integrated framework with procedures for better assessing CDWM performance. The literature review found that while some studies adopt a system thinking and life cycle thinking to assess CDWM performance, other research they adopt a sustainability based model to finalize CDWM performance assessment. The results also demonstrate that compared with environmental and economic aspects, the social aspect has attracted less attention. Social factors, however are crucial in CDWM. The findings about current performance assessment practices in CDWM and the proposed procedures are possible to implement for researchers and practitioners to develop sound CDWM approaches.}

In this paper a computational model of a human agent is presented which describes the effect of social support on mood. According to the literature, social support can either refer to the social resources that individuals perceive to be available or to the support that is actually provided in problematic situations. The proposed model distinguishes between both roles of social support. The role of social network characteristics has been taken into account, as an individual can perceive or receive social support through his/her social network. In addition, the number of connections (friends), strength of ties (relationships), social isolation and social integration have been studied. Simulation experiments have been done to analyze the effect of the different types of support in different scenarios and also to analyze the role of various social network characteristics on the mood level. It is shown that support can help to reduce the induced stress and thus can contribute to healthy mood regulation and prevention of depression. The presented model provides a basis for an intelligent support system for people with mood regulation problems that take the social network of people into account.}

abstract = {Cholinergic (Ach), Noradrenergic (NE), and Dopaminergic (DA) pathways play an important role in the regulation of spatial attention. The same neurotransmitters are also responsible for inter-individual differences in temperamental traits. Here we explored whether biologically defined temperamental traits determine differences in the ability to orient spatial attention as a function of the probabilistic association between cues and targets. To this aim, we administered the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) to a sample of 151 participants who also performed a Posner task with central endogenous predictive (80 % valid/20 % invalid) or non-predictive cues (50 % valid/50 % invalid). We found that only participants with high scores in Plasticity and Intellectual Endurance showed a selective abatement of attentional costs with non-predictive cues. In addition, stepwise regression showed that costs in the non-predictive condition were negatively predicted by scores in Plasticity and positively predicted by scores in Probabilistic Thinking. These results show that stable temperamental characteristics play an important role in defining the inter-individual differences in attentional behaviour, especially in the presence of different probabilistic organisations of the sensory environment. These findings emphasize the importance of considering temperamental and personality traits in social and professional environments where the ability to control one's attention is a crucial functional skill.}

abstract = {The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday life raises concerns for children, other marginalized groups, and the general public. As new AI implementations continue to emerge, it is crucial to enable children to engage critically with AI. Critical literacy objectives and practices can encourage children to question, critique, and transform the social, political, cultural, and ethical implications of AI. As an initial step towards critical AI education, we conducted a 10-year scoping review to identify publications reporting on activities that engage children, between the ages of 5 and 18, to address the critical implications of AI. Our review identifies a wide range of participants, content, and pedagogical approaches. Through framework synthesis guided by an established critical literacy model, we examine the critical literacy learning objectives embedded in the reported activities and propose a critical AI literacy framework. This paper outlines future opportunities for critical AI literacies in the field of child–computer interaction including inspiring new learning activities, encouraging inclusive perspectives, and supporting pragmatic curriculum integration.}

The variation in bolt force with external load predicted by the finite element analysis conforms well to the experimental results. It is demonstrated that certain detailed features such as thread interaction do not need to be modelled to ensure useful results. Behaviour during the pre-loading phase of use agrees with previous long-standing studies. However, the pre-loading analysis does not carry over to the stage when external loading is applied, as is normally assumed and it is shown that the current, conventional analytical methods substantially over-predict the proportion of the external load carried by the bolt. The basic reason for this is shown to be related to the non-linear variation in contact conditions between the clamped members during the external loading stage.}

Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus leads to the incorporation of thousands of new granule cells into the dentate gyrus every month, but its function remains unclear. Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways.}

A multiscale probabilistic simulation-optimization framework is developed based on the nested nature of watersheds to inform decision robustness for Best Management Practices (BMPs). We presented a novel approach using hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) as interpretable and probabilistic emulators of process-based models. The hybrid BNs established at the scale of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) are embedded into simulation-optimization, whereby we analyze the cost-effectiveness-robustness of candidate BMP strategies at the subbasin scale. The optimal strategy is identified in compliance with water quality standards using watershed-scale integer programming. We apply the approaches in a typical intensively cultivated plateau watershed adjacent to Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. Our findings suggest that the hybrid BNs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative information, are reliable emulators of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in capturing critical pathways of diffuse phosphorus. Tradeoffs among cost, effectiveness, and robustness follow the law of diminishing marginal benefits. The optimum BMP strategies vary with policymakers’ preference toward robustness levels. Our findings indicate that robustness should be accounted for as an additional decision attribute besides costs and pollution mitigation. The benefits of the modeling framework are to (i) reduce over 99% computation complexity and support efficient decision-making under multifaceted uncertainties; (ii) improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning emulators; and (iii) inform policymakers of robustness with the probability of water quality restoration success.}

Primitives of interpretation can be correctly viewed intentionally, as explanations of our choices of linguistic actions; the model therefore fits our intuitions about meaning in conversation.

However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.}

In this dichotomy we, i.e., the proponents of the network hypothesis, are inappropriately placed on the Lorenzian line. In particular, we argue that in contrast to Dhein's claim our concepts are not based on merely instinctive or peripheral modes of information processing. In general, on the one side our approaches have largely been motivated by the early biocybernetics way of thinking. On the other side they are deeply rooted in studies on the insect's behavioral ecology, i.e., in the ecological setting within which the navigational strategies have evolved and within which the animal now operates. Following such a bottom-up approach we are not “anti-cognitive map researchers” but argue that the results we have obtained in ants, and also the results of some decisive experiments in bees, can be explained and simulated without the need of invoking metric maps.}

Based on a set of global exemplars, this Perspective Essay outlines six key factors that can enhance efficacy of 3D digital environments to guide knowledge-informed landscape and urban planning. We call for (1) explicitly representing dynamic interplay between the social, ecological, and technical systems, (2) exploring the integration of design with simulation models to address cross-scale dynamics, (3) developing features to foster imagination, (4) employing multisensory stimuli to encourage profound changes in environmentally and socially sustainable behavior, (5) tailoring the incorporation of active sensing by and with non-experts into 3D digital environments to better acknowledge indigenous and local knowledge systems, and finally, (6) carrying out a usability evaluation to facilitate participation and collaboration in an efficient co-creation process. We conclude by recommending the establishment of a collaborative knowledge platform that unites researchers, developers, and stakeholders for stimulating social-ecological-technological system thinking in the development of 3D digital environments and harnessing the technological advancements to accelerate and drive the needed transformative change within urban and landscape planning.}

As a result, beside the development of a behavioral ABM, we open the ‘blackbox’ of purely empirical models.

This chapter discusses how different types of entities such as individual objects, sets of objects, and ensembles can function as items to be maintained in working memory (WM). All of these types of representations can be relevant to thinking about quantities, and each supports different kinds of quantity-relevant computations. One way to overcome the three- to four-item limit of WM is to bind together representations of individual objects into representations of sets of objects. Binding multiple individuals into a single higher-order group can increase the number of individual items that can be remembered, as in the well-known demonstrations of chunking by adults. Set representations play a critical role in many numerical processes, including representing the nested relationships between as well as representing the cardinality of an array. Many real-world scenes contain stimuli that do not lend themselves to representation qua individual objects or sets of objects. One can imagine enumerating a flock containing dozens of individual birds.}

Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.}

abstract = {Although there is a deep historical relationship between hydrology and society, the relationship has considerably evolved in the last three decades. Hydrologists, in particular those involved in designing of decision-support tools, are experiencing a widening gap between an academic discipline which has progressively moved away from field-based applied natural science to computational hydrology, and the multiplication of stakeholders involved in the water-related issues addressed by research. The challenge for hydrology is now to negotiate this shift and to rethink its engagement in society. This paper provides a description of a planned process designed to improve hydrology-society interactions and to foster reflexivity in socio-hydrology. Based on an interdisciplinary reflexive process undertaken in Tunisia from 2016 to 2020, we identified three types of discomforts in the dialogue with society, inviting scientists to lucidly engage with these discomforts. We formulated four key reflexive propositions to achieve a better alignment of scientific stance, research practices and discourse. The first proposition concerns the need to explain more clearly the value systems scientists engage in and with society. The second concerns the need to position hydrology in society and not outside it, by reconsidering the functions that research fulfils in society. The third is an invitation to redefine the perimeter of the research interlocutors and the way to reach them. The fourth is to revisit scientific practices to build on the strengths of the dialogue between field-based natural science and computational hydrology. The paper concludes that adopting a reflexive posture towards these four dimensions of the dialogue between hydrology and society is an effective way to overcome discomforts and to refocus research stance, practices and discourse. It is a way to renew hydrology's place in society and to contribute to the current thinking in socio-hydrology initiated by hydrologists.}

Its dominant paradigms such as utility theory, prospect theory, and the modern dual-process theories all resort to formal algebraic models or non-mathematical postulates, and remain purely phenomenological. An approach introduced by Grossberg deployed differential equations describing neural networks and bridged the gap between decision science and the psychology of cognitive–emotional interactions. However, the limits within which neural models can explain data from real people’s actions are virtually untested and remain unknown. Here we show that a model built around a recurrent gated dipole can successfully forecast individual economic choices in a complex laboratory experiment. Unlike classical statistical and econometric techniques or machine learning algorithms, our method calibrates the equations for each individual separately, and carries out prediction person-by-person. It predicted very well the behaviour of 15%–20% of the participants in the experiment–half of them extremely well–and was overall useful for two thirds of all 211 subjects. The model succeeded with people who were guided by gut feelings and failed with those who had sophisticated strategies. One hypothesis is that this neural network is the biological substrate of the cognitive system for primitive–intuitive thinking, and so we believe that we have a model of how people choose economic options by a simple form of intuition. We anticipate our study to be useful for further studies of human intuitive thinking as well as for analyses of economic systems populated by heterogeneous agents.}

abstract = {The image decomposition based method is one of the efficient and important face recognition solutions for the single sample per person problem. The low image decomposition performance and the unconvincing reconstruction of the approximation image are the two main limitations of the previous methods. In this paper, a new single sample face recognition method based on lower-upper (LU) decomposition algorithm is proposed. The procedure of the proposed method is as following. First, the single sample and its transpose are decomposed to two sets of basis images by using the LU decomposition algorithm, which is more efficient than the image decomposition algorithms of the previous works. Two approximation images are reconstructed from the two basis image sets by the reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis. Then, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) algorithm is used to evaluate the optimal projection space by using the new training set consisting of the single sample and its two approximation images for each person. Finally, the nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance is adopted as the final classification. We make two main contributions: one is that we propose to decompose the single sample and its transpose using the efficient LU decomposition algorithm, and reorder each basis image set according to the basis image energy; the other is that we present a reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis to reconstruct the approximation image. The performance of the proposed method is verified using four public face databases, namely FERET, AR, ORL and Yale B. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches which are proposed to address the single sample per person problem.}

Many digital health initiatives have been developed and employed. However, barriers to their large-scale implementation have remained. This paper focuses on these barriers and presents solutions as proposed by the Dutch CARRIER (ie, Coronary ARtery disease: Risk estimations and Interventions for prevention and EaRly detection) consortium. We will focus in 4 sections on the following: (1) the development process of an eHealth solution that will include design thinking and cocreation with relevant stakeholders; (2) the modeling approach for two clinical prediction models (CPMs) to identify people at risk of developing ASCVD and to guide interventions; (3) description of a federated data infrastructure to train the CPMs and to provide the eHealth solution with relevant data; and (4) discussion of an ethical and legal framework for responsible data handling in health care. The Dutch CARRIER consortium consists of a collaboration between experts in the fields of eHealth development, ASCVD, public health, big data, as well as ethics and law. The consortium focuses on reducing the burden of ASCVD. We believe the future of health care is data driven and supported by digital health. Therefore, we hope that our research will not only facilitate CARRIER consortium but may also facilitate other future health care initiatives.}

Novel computational methods such as artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and genetic programming are used in this chapter for the modeling of the nonlinear behavior of composite laminates subjected to constant amplitude loading. The examined computational methods are stochastic nonlinear regression tools, and can therefore be used to model the fatigue behavior of any material, provided that sufficient data are available for training. They are material-independent methods that simply follow the trend of the available data, in each case giving the best estimate of their behavior. Application on a wide range of experimental data gathered after fatigue testing glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates proved that their modeling ability compares favorably with, and is to some extent superior to, other modeling techniques.}

This paper examines the implementation of the DBS concept as a new teaching model to improve the problem-solving skills (PSS) of first-year students in engineering education. It also discusses the effectson learning experiences and pedagogical outcomes in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The research’s results identify the significance of applying this model as a real-simulated method-based learning experience. It can help students to improve their learning experiences and to enhance students self-confidence regarding PSS.}

abstract = {The present study employed commercial computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS 2019R3 to explore the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the net heat flux reduction (NHFR) for the comparison of the five selected shaped holes and conventional cylindrical holes between the pressure surface, the suction surface and the leading edge. Amo4ng the shape parameters of shaped holes, the lateral divergence angle (β) and the forward divergence angle (δ) were fixed as 12° and 7° in all shaped holes structures, respectively. The others varied with different regions of the turbine vane. Results showed that different holes fit different positions of vanes. On the suction surface, laidback holes performed the worst net heat flux reduction in most blowing ratios conditions, which indicated the forward divergence angle was not conducive to the flow field and heat transfer characteristics on the suction surface. Whereas, the lateral divergence angle was beneficial to the film cooling and heat transfer characteristics. Laidback fan-shaped holes performed the best adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, but once simultaneously thinking about the heat transfer, fan-shaped holes performed better in net heat flux reduction due to less vortices at holes exit. On the leading edge, the divergence angle towards the upper wall (the lateral divergence angle of spanwise expansion holes) of vanes was not conducive to steady flow. And conical holes performed best, which indicated that coolant from holes with axial divergence angles (the lateral divergence angle in axial direction of conical holes) under the influence of mainstream impact could perform higher film cooling effectiveness and more stable flow fields. On the pressure surface, holes had a lateral divergence angle in the direction of vane height, which was conducive to increasing the coolant coverage area and improving the ability to attach to the pressure surface. Additionally, the laidback hole case was observed the lowest net heat flux reduction when the blowing ratio was less than 2, which revealed that holes that expanded only in flow direction was not conducive to film cooling and heat transfer characteristics.}

FEA has been used in bone research for more than 30years and has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the complex behavior of bone. Bone is structured in a hierarchical way covering many length scales and this chapter reflects this hierarchical organization. In particular, the focus is on the applications of FEA for understanding the relationship between bone structure and its mechanical function at specific hierarchical levels. Depending on the hierarchical level, different issues have been investigated with FEA ranging from more clinically oriented topics related to bone quality (e.g., predicting bone strength and fracture risk) to more fundamental problems dealing with the mechanical aspects of biological processes (e.g., stress and strain around osteocyte lacunae) as well as with the micromechanical behavior of bone at its ultrastructure. A better understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical function is expected to be important for the current trends in (bio)materials design, where the structure of biological materials is considered as a possible source of inspiration, as well as for more successful approaches in the prevention and treatment of age- and disease-related fractures.}
