abstract = {This study investigated gender differences in 11 cognitive tests from a sample of grade 11 students in Shanghai, China. Research found that the girls outperformed boys significantly on Word Knowledge and Word Span tasks, and also on a Computational Speed and Accuracy test. Boys outperformed girls only on the Paper Folding test. Factor based scores showed that girls were superior to boys on memory, and verbal composites, whereas boys were superior to girls on the spatial composites. No gender differences were found on the Mathematical Thinking test and other reasoning tests. The research findings seemed to suggest that where the social conditions were more uniform the gender differences on visual-spatial and mathematical reasoning skills would be smaller.}

In particular, this strategy is highly efficient (both in terms of accuracy and complexity) when the kernel is data-adapted using Kernel Flows (KF) (Owhadi and Yoo, 2019), (which uses gradient-based optimization to learn a kernel based on the premise that a kernel is good if there is no significant loss in accuracy if half of the data is used for interpolation). In this work, we extend previous work on learning dynamical systems using Kernel Flows (Hamzi and Owhadi, 2021; Darcy et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2023; Darcy et al. 2023; Owhadi and Romit Maulik, 2021) to the case of learning vector-valued dynamical systems from time-series observations that are partial/incomplete in the state space.

One aspect of this is addressing how computational models can appropriately reproduce the variation seen in experimental data, with one solution being to use populations of models united by a common set of equations (the framework), with each individual member of the population (each model) possessing its own unique set of equation parameters. These model populations are then calibrated and validated against experimental data, and as a whole reproduce the experimentally observed variation. The primary focus of validation thus becomes the population, with the individual models' validation seemingly deriving from their membership of this population. The role of individual models within the population is not clear, with uncertainty regarding the relationship between individual models and the population they make up. This work examines the role of models within the population, how they relate to the population they make up, and how both can be said to be validated in this context.}

Emerging research suggests the brain operates as a “prediction machine,” continuously anticipating sensory, motor, and cognitive outcomes. Central to this capability is the brain's spontaneous activity—ongoing internal processes independent of external stimuli. Neuroimaging and computational studies support that this activity is integral to maintaining and refining mental models of our environment, body, and behaviors, akin to generative models in computation. During rest, spontaneous activity expands the variability of potential representations, enhancing the accuracy and adaptability of these models. When performing tasks, internal models direct brain regions to anticipate sensory and motor states, optimizing performance. This review synthesizes evidence from various species, from C. elegans to humans, highlighting three key aspects of spontaneous brain activity’s role in prediction: the similarity between spontaneous and task-related activity, the encoding of behavioral and interoceptive priors, and the high metabolic cost of this activity, underscoring prediction as a fundamental function of brains across species.}

The cleaning schedules can be optimized to save economic expenses through the methods capable of estimating the power loss of PV modules resulting from soiling. This paper proposes a deep learning framework that combines visible light and infrared image information with dual branch cross-modality feature fusion. Initially, the MobileNetV2 is applied as the backbone of the dual branch framework to enhance the training efficiency and reduce the computational complexity. Subsequently, a cross-modality differential aware fusion module based on the channel attention mechanism (CA-CMDAF) is introduced to improve the cross-modality feature fusion capability of the model. Moreover, a multi-cascade and cross-modality fusion network and a multi-scale fusion network are integrated to further facilitate the effectiveness of feature fusion and reduce the loss of visual details during the feature extraction. Lastly, extensive experiments are carried out on the multi-modality dataset. The comparison results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed dual branch network framework with the average accuracy of 88.27 %, which is higher than that of the single-modality models trained on either visible light or infrared images alone.}

We review evidence that anxiety is linked to increased simulations of the future occurrence of high cost negative events and to elevated estimates of the probability of occurrence of such events. We also review psychological theories of PTSD in the light of newer, computational models of updating through replay and simulation. We consider whether pathological levels of re-experiencing symptomatology might reflect problems reconciling the traumatic outcome with overly optimistic priors or difficulties terminating off-line simulation focused on negative events and over-generalization to states sharing features with those antecedent to the trauma.}

It is worth exploring these aspects of the disjuncture between the mainstream and ABM practitioners for two reasons – to frame a discussion of qualities of ABM that make it transformative and to provide guidelines for broadening ABM’s applicability.

The 13C NMR spectra and electron densities for the disulfonyl, nitro, and cyano carbon acids were calculated at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The calculated chemical shifts for disulfonyl carbanions show satisfying correlation with our own experimental data. The calculated π electron densities at the Cα atom correspond roughly to the “experimental” π electron densities estimated from the 13C chemical shifts. The natural charges at Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions are significantly more negative than with other types of carbanions, partly because of the significant negative natural charge of the α carbon in parent carbon acids. The calculated increase of the negative charge caused by ionization is larger for sulfonyl carbon acids than for cyano- and nitroalkanes. The 13C chemical shifts δ of Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions decrease with more negative calculated negative natural charge at Cα, with a slope of 220ppm/electron. The influence of phenyl ring para-substitution on the charge distribution in carbanions and relationship between the 13C chemical shifts and charge density have been discussed. It appears that the π electron density in these planar or nearly planar carbanions has a decisive impact on the chemical shifts.}

To obtain the alternatives, the officers that best fit the established vacancy, and the criteria to be evaluated, Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) was applied. Next, with all the necessary data, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method was used as a Multicriteria Decision Support (MDS) technique, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method, the CRITIC Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the criteria weights and the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method, with three normalizations, to order the alternatives.

Counterparts to computational science such as computational linguistice, computational engineering and others arc beginning to take roots. Naturally, new research paths and opportunities in computational epidemiology must also be explored. One of the major challenges in epidemiologic research is the issue of how to realistically and effectively handle complex bioepidemiologic dynamics involving interactions between humans or animals, etiological agents and the multiple array of environmental and socioeconomic determinants which affect these populations. To understand the behavior of such complex biological systems, it is useful to devise computer based simulation models. Computational epidemiologic approaches now provide alternative avenues to classical laboratory and/or field experimental methods. Systems which may be impractical because they are too large, or, not feasible because the cost is too prohibitive can now be simulated realistically. In the past obtaining solutions to biomathematical equations with any degree of complexity was impossible. However, the availability of powerful computers now makes the quantitative analysis of such systems feasible and indeed practical. With this in mind our research at Tuskegee University has focused on: a) Epidemiologic modelling and expert systems, and, b) Hypertext/hypermedia based epidemiologic knowledge management. The case studies for our research involve the bioepidemiologic dynamics of two complex host-parasite systems of trypanosoma and schistosoma. The ultimate goal is to develop resources and methodologies based on computational technology to advance epidemiologic research. The paper will address the methodological issues and findings as well as questions related to configuring an appropriate research workstation for computational epidemiology.}

abstract = {Objective
During initial assessment of trauma patients, metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with high-risk clinical conditions. Yet, despite numerous studies, the potential of HRV to improve clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether HRV metrics provide additional diagnostic information, beyond routine vital signs, for making a specific clinical assessment: identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.
Methods
Adult prehospital trauma patients were analyzed retrospectively, excluding those who lacked a complete set of reliable vital signs and a clean electrocardiogram for computation of HRV metrics. We also excluded patients who did not survive to admission. The primary outcome was hemorrhagic injury plus different PRBC transfusion volumes. We performed multivariate regression analysis using HRV metrics and routine vital signs to test the hypothesis that HRV metrics could improve the diagnosis of hemorrhagic injury plus PRBC transfusion vs routine vital signs alone.
Results
As univariate predictors, HRV metrics in a data set of 402 subjects had comparable areas under receiver operating characteristic curves compared with routine vital signs. In multivariate regression models containing routine vital signs, HRV parameters were significant (P < .05) but yielded areas under receiver operating characteristic curves with minimal, nonsignificant improvements (+0.00 to +0.05).
Conclusions
A novel diagnostic test should improve diagnostic thinking and allow for better decision making in a significant fraction of cases. Our findings do not support that HRV metrics add value over routine vital signs in terms of prehospital identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive PRBC transfusion.}

However, current theoretical perspectives on personal epistemology focus more on scientific ways of knowing where knowledge is abstracted and logical. We conducted semi-structured interviews to investigate medical students’ personal epistemological thinking towards the end of their second year of training at a new medical school in the South West of England. Whilst responses were varied, students appeared to express predominantly simplistic levels of epistemological thinking according to current developmental models of personal epistemology.

The participants also completed the alternate uses task (AUT) during an electroencephalography (EEG) assessment to evaluate creative thinking. Alpha power was used to quantify neural oscillations during the creative process, while alpha coherence was used to quantify information communication between frontal regions and other sites during creative ideation. Moreover, these two task-related quantitative measures were combined to investigate the relationship between individual differences in everyday creativity and EEG alpha activity during creative idea generation. Compared with the reference period, increased alpha power was observed in the frontal cortex of the right hemisphere and increased functional coupling was observed between frontal and parietal/temporal regions during the activation period. Interestingly, individual differences in everyday creativity were associated with distinct patterns of EEG alpha activity. Specifically, individuals with higher everyday creativity had increased alpha power in the frontal cortex, and increased changes in coherence in frontal-temporal regions of the right hemisphere while performing the AUT. It might indicate that individuals with higher everyday creativity had an enhanced ability to focus on internal information processing and control bottom-up stimuli, as well as better selection of novel semantic information when performing creative ideation tasks.}

Specifically, we review examples of linear free-energy relationships (LFERs) for enzyme reactions and discuss how LFERs and the associated Sabatier Principle may be implemented in algorithms that estimate kinetic parameters and enzyme performance based on model structures.}

It is argued that production system models constitute an alternative or necessary complementary approach if the goal is to develop models of interdependent activity and travel choices, or activity scheduling, which are based on behavioral science theories of higher cognitive processes. Several computational-process models (CPMs) which implement production systems as computer programs are reviewed. Currently, no encompassing CPM exists but some may be possible to integrate in a descriptive model of activity scheduling.}

Traditionally, AI is developed in software or through neuromorphic engineering in hardware. More recently, a brand-new strategy has been proposed. It is the so-called Chemical AI (CAI), which exploits molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry in wetware to mimic human intelligence. In this work, two promising approaches for boosting CAI are described. One regards designing and implementing neural surrogates that can communicate through optical or chemical signals and give rise to networks for computational purposes and to develop micro/nanorobotics. The other approach concerns “bottom-up synthetic cells” that can be exploited for applications in various scenarios, including future nano-medicine. Both topics are presented at a basic level, mainly to inform the broader audience of non-specialists, and so favour the rise of interest in these frontier subjects.}

From the perspective of the educational system, it is essential to understand the roles of robotics in education as well as their relationships with learners. Specifically, this systematic review proposed a conceptual framework based on two dimensions (i.e., learner agency, robotic interactivity) and reviewed 92 empirical studies from 2010 to 2023 to clarify four categories of robotic roles, namely learning about robotics, learning through robotics, learning from robotics, and learning with robotics. In learning about robotics, educational robotics are merely the learning objects or contents by learners. In learning through robotics, educational robotics serve as the learning tools or assists, and learners can take their agency to operate or design robotics. In learning from robotics, educational robotics act as tutors to convey and deliver knowledge and information to learners. In learning with robotics, educational robotics serve as the peers or companions of learners and collaborate with learners to provide emotional supports, solve problems and construct knowledge. Furthermore, this study examined the applied educational contexts (i.e., educational domain, educational level) and learning effects of the four robotic roles. Overall, the future development of robotics education highlights both learner agency and robotic interactivity to achieve the goal of a learner-centered, robot-friendly learning.}

Mathematical modeling approaches for analyzing kinetics and dynamics, including deterministic, stochastic, and hybrid models, are presented. Experimental techniques like transport measurements, calorimetry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and neutron scattering are highlighted for investigating kinetics and dynamics. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics simulations and deep learning are also explored for studying biomolecular processes. Applications of kinetics and dynamics are illustrated through examples in areas like fuel-driven dynamic combinatorial libraries, self-assembly, and gene regulatory networks. Key discoveries enabled by kinetics and dynamics research are summarized, including dynamic heterogeneity, kinetic proofreading, biological switches, and single-molecule insights. The chapter emphasizes on the importance of integrating experimental data with computational modeling to deepen the understanding of biological systems across multiple scales. Future directions are outlined, such as studying interactomes, DNA mechanics, metabolic regulation, and developing advanced microtechnologies to further unravel the complex kinetic and dynamic behavior underlying diverse biological phenomena.}

Alzheimer is the most general form of dementia in the elderly. Recently, biomotivated techniques have become famous in the domain of healthcare and have obtained appreciable success. This review shows that these techniques are mostly utilized to resolve various problems such as image segmentation, feature selection, classification, and optimization in the detection of various disorders like cancer, anemia, Alzheimer, kidney and skin diseases. It is observed that the dementia diagnosis was performed using classical approaches which led to reduced performance (accuracy, precision). This performance parameter can be enhanced by using biomotivated techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the different role of biomotivated metaheuristics in the domain of dementia diagnosis with a detailed analysis of published work.

abstract = {Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analyzed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in nonlinear processes. An observer's notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtlely though on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer's chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data. This paper presents an overview of an inductive framework-hierarchical ϵ-machine reconstruction—in which the emergence of complexity is associated with the innovation of new computational model classes. Complexity metrics for detecting structure and quantifying emergence, along with an analysis of the constraints on the dynamics of innovation, are outlined. Illustrative examples are drawn from the onset of unpredictability in nonlinear systems, finitary nondeterministic processes, and cellular automata pattern recognition. They demonstrate how finite inference resources drive the innovation of new structures and so lead to the emergence of complexity.}

Moreover, this study is aimed at identifying which methods are used for studying this phenomenon, with a focus on the Life Cycle Thinking-oriented ones. Journal articles and conference proceedings were considered. At the end of the screening phases, 54 documents were selected and reviewed. The results showed that acceptance concerns two main issues: biogas plants and its presence in a given location and digestate application on fields. This review showed different results between high-income and low-middle-income countries. As regards the former, trust was the most mentioned socio-cultural factor. Education, as well as women's living conditions were considered important in the latter. However, a contextualisation of every outcome based on local peculiarities is needed in order to understand in a better way the accepting/refuting phenomena of the projects. As regards the second objective of this study, Life Cycle Analysis resulted the most widespread Life Cycle Thinking methodology. In conclusion, the outcomes of this work may be useful to identify the non-technical factors and the most suitable approach that should be considered for a successful implementation of site-specific biogas projects.}

In this paper, the importance of abduction in creative engineering processes is briefly reviewed. It has been shown that abductive reasoning plays a key role in design as it is the only logical operation that introduces new ideas. Its encouragement within the KTH Royal Institute of Technology's degree projects at the Department of Aeronautical and Vehicle Engineering is analysed by examining the stated intended learning outcomes, and through interviewing students. It is found that abductive reasoning is not explicitly encouraged within the intended learning outcomes of these degree project courses, despite its importance in creative thinking. Although, it is very likely that at least some abduction takes place in the project work, its absence from the intended learning outcomes means that students may not have a felt need to demonstrate their abductive reasoning, and supervisors may encourage only non-creative deductive or inductive reasoning. A more explicit inclusion of abductive reasoning in the intended learning outcomes would help both students and supervisors to include creative thinking in the degree project courses.}

Notably, one and only one reduct is derived through using one searching strategy in most cases. Nevertheless, only one reduct may be not enough for us to evaluate its effectiveness. To fill such gap, an approach of crosswise computing reduct is proposed for obtaining multiple reducts. The computation of reduct is realized through partitioning the whole data into several groups, and crosswise selecting some groups to form different subsets of data, then computing reducts over these different subsets of data. Moreover, to speed up the process of crosswise computing reduct, an acceleration strategy is designed. The main thinking of our acceleration strategy is to compute the reduct over different subsets of data on the basis of reduct over the whole data. The experimental results over 16 data sets show the following superiorities of our strategy: (1) our approach can decrease the elapsed time of crosswise computing reducts significantly; (2) our approach can not only provide reduct with higher stability, but also maintain the classification performance; (3) the attributes in reduct can provide more stable classification results.}

We develop a clustering method that takes advantage of the sturdiness of model-based clustering, while attempting to mitigate this issue. The proposed approach allows each margin to have a varying number of clusters and employs a strategy game-inspired algorithm, named ‘Reign-and-Conquer’, to cluster the data. Since the proposed clustering approach only specifies a model for the margins, but leaves the joint unspecified, it has the advantage of being partially parallelizable; hence, the proposed approach is computationally appealing as well as more tractable for moderate to high dimensions than a ‘full’ (joint) model-based clustering approach. A battery of numerical experiments on simulated data indicates an overall good performance of the proposed methods in a variety of scenarios, and real datasets are used to showcase their usefulness in practice.}

While not losing sight of the logical role, our framework puts a special emphasis on the heuristic process, and aims at offering to the historian and philosopher of science as well as the physicist some tools to capture the subtle functions of analogical reasoning involved in such a process. After having traced it out theoretically, we make use of this framework to interpret the growth of the ideas of two remarkable physicists dealing with the multifaceted notion of vacuum in 20th century physics. We first consider the trajectory followed by John A. Wheeler, between the 1960s and 1970s, towards (in his own words) a “geology of the vacuum”; and then examine, starting from the hitherto neglected Japanese reception of the idea of Dirac sea in the early 1930s, the pathway that led Yoichiro Nambu to the discovery of spontaneous symmetry breaking.}

Previous work suggests that certain statistical regularities in speech could help infants segment the speech stream into words, thereby forming a proto-lexicon that could support learning of the eventual vocabulary. However, computational models of word segmentation have typically been tested using language input that is much less variable than actual speech is. We show that using actual, transcribed pronunciations rather than dictionary pronunciations of the same speech leads to worse segmentation performance across models. We also find that phonologically variable input poses serious problems for lexicon building, because even correctly segmented word forms exhibit a complex, many-to-many relationship with speakers' intended words. Many phonologically distinct word forms were actually the same intended word, and many identical transcriptions came from different intended words. The fact that previous models appear to have substantially overestimated the utility of simple statistical heuristics suggests a need to consider the formation of the lexicon in infancy differently.}

A key finding is that the majority of existing risk assessment methods are not consistent with Rasmussen’s model of accident causation (arguably the most popular model in safety science circles). Instead, the majority of risk assessment methods focus on risks at the so called sharp-end and largely view accidents as emerging from a linear, or chain-of-events process. This overlooks emergent risks at other levels of the system, including supervisory, managerial, regulatory and government levels. The findings therefore suggest that the majority of existing risk assessment methods may be inadequate for identifying hazards and analysing risks within complex sociotechnical systems. The implications for risk assessment practice are discussed.}

Few species engage in coalitional aggression, even though the social conditions that would favor its evolution seem to be widespread. Why? Forming coalitions to exploit these opportunities requires individuals to solve highly complex and specialized information processing problems involving cooperation, coordination, and social exchange. The difficulty of evolving cognitive mechanisms capable of solving these problems—especially when the individuals involved are not kin—may explain why multi-individual coalitions are phylogenetically rare. We propose that humans and a few other cognitively pre-adapted species have evolved specialized cognitive programs that govern coalitional behavior, which constitute a distinctive coalitional psychology. To derive a preliminary map of this psychology, we started with a task analysis of the adaptive information-processing problems that arise during coalitional aggression. This exercise can shine light on our evolved psychology because algorithms that motivate and organize coalitional aggression would need design features that solve these problems well to be favored by selection. These problems include decisions about when to form a coalition or join one, when to initiate an attack, and how to allocate the costs and benefits that result from coalitional action. The risk contract of war identifies circumstances under which natural selection would favor decisions to initiate an attack. When the conditions of this model are met, mortality rates will not negatively impact the fitness of males in the winning coalition. This outcome has implications for the design of computational systems that motivate coalitional attacks; it may explain why warfare is so favored an activity among men, despite its risks to the participating individuals' welfare.}

abstract = {Accompanying the increasing advances and interest in Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies is an increasing demand for an industrial workforce that is knowledgeable about the technologies and how to apply them to solve real-world problems. As a step towards addressing this knowledge gap, a workshop was held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) to discuss the educational needs to prepare industry for AM and its use in different fields. The workshop participants – 66 representatives from academia, industry, and government – identified several key educational themes: (1) AM processes and process/material relationships, (2) engineering fundamentals with an emphasis on materials science and manufacturing, (3) professional skills for problem solving and critical thinking, (4) design practices and tools that leverage the design freedom enabled by AM, and (5) cross-functional teaming and ideation techniques to nurture creativity. This paper summarizes the industry speakers and presentations from the workshop, along with several new educational partnerships identified by small working groups. Based on the presentations and partnerships, the following recommendations are offered to advance the AM workforce. First, ensure that all AM curricula provide students with an understanding of (i) AM and traditional manufacturing processes to enable them to effectively select the appropriate process for product realization; (ii) the relationships between AM processes and material properties; and (iii) “Design for AM”, including computational tools for AM design as well as frameworks for process selection, costing, and solution generation that take advantage of AM capabilities. Second, establish a national network for AM education that, by leveraging existing “distributed” educational models and NSF’s Advanced Technology Education (ATE) Programs, provides open source resources as well as packaged activities, courses, and curricula for all educational levels (K-Gray). Third, support K-12 educational programs in STEAM (STEM plus the arts) and across all formal and informal learning environments in order to learn the unique capabilities of AM while engaging students in hands-on, tactile, and visual learning activities to prepare them for jobs in industry while learning how to think differently when designing for AM. Fourth, provide support for collaborative and community-oriented maker spaces that promote awareness of AM among the public and provide AM training programs for incumbent workers in industry and students seeking alternative pathways to gain AM knowledge and experience. Recommendations for scaling and coordination across local, regional, and national levels are also discussed to create synergies among the proposed activities and existing efforts.}

We thus argue that studying goal selection is essential to advance our understanding of learning. By following existing literature in framing goal selection within a hierarchy of decision-making problems, we synthesize important findings on the principles underlying goal value attribution and exploration strategies. Ultimately, we propose that a goal-centric perspective will help develop more complete accounts of learning in both biological and artificial agents.}

abstract = {Objective
Computational fluid dynamics have been used to study the hemodynamic performance of surgical operations, resulting in improved design. Efficient designs with minimal energy losses are especially important for cavopulmonary connections. The purpose of this study was to compare hydraulic performance between the hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures, as well as the various types of completion Fontan operations.
Methods
Three-dimensional models were constructed of typical hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn operations according to anatomic data derived from magnetic resonance scans, angiocardiograms, and echocardiograms. Boundary conditions were imposed, and fluid dynamics were calculated from a mathematic code. Power losses, flow distribution to each lung, and pressures were measured at three predetermined levels of pulmonary arteriolar resistance. Models of the lateral tunnel, total cavopulmonary connection, and extracardiac conduit completion Fontan operations were constructed, and power losses, total flow distribution, vena caval and pulmonary arterial pressures, and flow distribution of inferior vena caval return were calculated.
Results
The hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures performed nearly identically, with similar power losses and nearly equal flow distributions to each lung at all levels of pulmonary arteriolar resistance. However, the lateral tunnel Fontan procedure as performed after the hemi-Fontan operation had lower power losses (6.9 mW, pulmonary arteriolar resistance 3 units) than the total cavopulmonary connection (40.5 mW) or the extracardiac conduit (42.9 mW), although the inclusion of an enlargement patch toward the right in the total cavopulmonary connection was effective in reducing the difference (10.0 mW). Inferior vena caval flow to the right lung was 52% for the lateral tunnel, compared with 19%, 30%, 19%, and 15% for the total cavopulmonary connection, total cavopulmonary connection with right-sided enlargement patch, extracardiac conduit, and extracardiac conduit with a bevel to the left lung, respectively.
Conclusions
According to these methods, the hemi-Fontan and bidirectional Glenn procedures performed equally well, but important differences in energy losses and flow distribution were found after the completion Fontan procedures. The superior hydraulic performance of the lateral tunnel Fontan operation after the hemi-Fontan procedure relative to any other method may be due to closer to optimal caval offset achieved in the surgical reconstruction.}

For triples of quantitative variables, the method of choice is 3D data rotations. Such rotations let us perceive structure among three variables as shape of point scatters in virtual 3D space. Although not obvious, three-dimensional data rotations can be extended to higher dimensions. The mathematical construction of high-dimensional data rotations, however, is not an intuitive generalization. Whereas three-dimensional data rotations are thought of as rotations of an object in space, a proper framework for their high-dimensional extension is better based on rotations of a low-dimensional projection in high-dimensional space. The term “data rotations” is therefore a misnomer, and something along the lines of “high-to-low dimensional data projections” would be technically more accurate. To be useful, virtual rotations need to be under interactive user control, and they need to be animated. We therefore require projections not as static pictures but as movies under user control. Movies, however, are mathematically speaking one-parameter families of pictures. This article is therefore about one-parameter families of low-dimensional projections in high-dimensional data spaces. We describe several algorithms for dynamic projections, all based on the idea of smoothly interpolating a discrete sequence of projections. The algorithms lend themselves to the implementation of interactive visual exploration tools of high-dimensional data, such as so-called grand tours, guided tours and manual tours.}

Thus, this paper is about the use of systems thinking and systems theory in EA and about how it is possible to reconcile and understand, based on a single overarching framework, the interplay of two major enterprise change endeavours: on one hand enterprise engineering (i.e. deliberate change) and on the other hand evolutionary, organic change. The paper also demonstrates how such change processes can be illustrated by employing systems thinking to construct dynamic business models; the evolution of these concepts is exemplified using past applications in networked enterprise building, and more recent proposals in environmental-, disaster- and healthcare management. Finally, the paper attempts to plot the way GERAM, as a framework to think about the creation and evolution of complex socio-technical systems, will continue to contribute to the society in the context of future challenges and emerging opportunities.}

Although modern computational techniques for data analysis such as simulation, randomization, and bootstrapping have the potential to make the idea of randomness more concrete, representing such random processes with R code is not as easy for students to understand as is something like a coin-flip, which is both concrete and embodied. In this study, in the context of multimedia learning, we designed and tested the efficacy of an instructional sequence that preceded computational simulations with embodied demonstrations. We investigated the role that embodied hands-on movement might play in facilitating students’ understanding of the shuffle function in R. Our findings showed that students who watched a video of hands shuffling data written on pieces of paper learned more from a subsequent live-coding demonstration of randomization using R than did students only introduced to the concept using R. Although others have found an advantage of students themselves engaging in hands-on activities, this study showed that merely watching someone else engage can benefit learning. Implications for online and remote instruction are discussed.}

The use of μPMUs can significantly improve the accuracy of estimates. However, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) need to consider optimization constraints before deciding on the optimal location of μPMUs. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes the use of DPPBSO (Discrete Predator-Prey Brain Storm Optimization) of Evolutionary Computation (EC) to optimize the location of μPMUs. PPBSO is an extension method that applies the Predator-Prey strategy to Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), and DPPSO is the discrete version of PPBSO used in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The Predator-Prey strategy is critical in improving the solution candidates by intensifying and diversifying solution searches in EC. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the IEEE 69-node distribution system.}

The present paper is focused on modelling the circular dichroism spectra of chiral buckybowls, combining topological aspects and the density functional theory. For the first time Ball Pivoting Algorithm was proposed to hook up the chemical topology to the DFT through the surface reconstruction. Particularly, the gaussian curvature of a constructed probe set of corannulene and sumanene derivatives was used as discriminant parameter to benchmark a list of 10 functionals (B3LYP, B97D, M06-2X, HSEH1PBE, wB97XD, CAM-B3LYP, LC-wPBE, TPSSTPSS, mPW1PW91 and APFD). The latter provide to be noticeably accurate to reproduce the curvature effect of the considered molecules. A TD-DFT/BOMD mixed approach provided a comprehensive overview of the spectral chiral pattern prediction trends when multiple DFT functionals are scanned. The preliminary topological analysis efforts were then recompensed with the very precise computed CD spectra, again APFD confirmed as the leader functional, this time for TD-DFT vertical transition calculations. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of the of dispersion embedded APFD functional coupled with the 6–311++G(2d,2p) basis set for the computation of the functionalized chiral buckybowls ECD spectra. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The heterogeneity of this dimension and its overlap with neurocognitive deficits are still debated. Within the multicenter study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses, we investigated electrophysiological and neurocognitive correlates of disorganization and its component items to assess the heterogeneity of this dimension and its possible overlap with neurocognitive deficits. Resting state EEG was recorded in 145 stabilized SCZ and 69 matched healthy controls (HC). Spectral amplitude was averaged in ten frequency bands. Neurocognitive domains were assessed by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). RAndomization Graphical User software explored band spectral amplitude differences between groups and correlations with disorganization and MCCB scores in SCZ. Correlations between disorganization and MCCB scores were also investigated. Compared to HC, SCZ showed increased delta, theta, and beta 1 and decreased alpha 2 activity. A negative correlation between alpha 1 and disorganization was observed in SCZ. At the item level, only “N5” showed the same correlation. MCCB neurocognitive composite score was associated with disorganization, “P2” and “N5”. Our findings suggest only a partial overlap between disorganization and neurocognitive impairment. The association of alpha 1 with the “N5” item suggests that some aspects of disorganization could be underpinned by the impairment of basic neurobiological functions that are only partially evaluated using MCCB.}

abstract = {With the progress of artificial intelligence, big data and functional neuroimaging technologies, brain computing has rapidly advanced our understanding of brain intelligence and brain disorders. We argue that existing data analytical methods have become insufficient for brain computing when dealing with multiple brain big data sources, because such methods mainly focus on flattening strategies and fail to work well for systematic understanding of the constituent elements of cognition, emotion and disease, as well as the intra- and inter-relations within and among themselves. To address this problem, we present in this paper a novel multi-source brain computing platform by Data-Brain driven systematic fusion. First, we formalize a series of behaviors surrounding the Brain Informatics-based investigation process, and present a conceptual model to systematically represent content and context of functional neuroimaging data. Then, we propose the systematic brain computing framework with multi-aspect fusion and inference to understand brain specificity and give uncertainty quantification, as well as its inspiration and applications for translational studies on brain health. In particular, a graph matching-based task search algorithm is introduced to help systematic experimental design and data sampling with multiple cognitive tasks. The study increases the interpretability and transparency of brain computing findings by inferring and testing multiple hypotheses taking into consideration the effect of evidence combination. Finally, multiple sources of knowledge (K), information (I) and data (D) are driven by a KID loop as the thinking space to inspire never-ending learning and multi-dimensional interactions in the connected social–cyber–physical spaces. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed brain computing method with systematic fusion.}

abstract = {Aim
The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process.
Background
The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation.
Design
Discussion paper.
Methods
We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results.
Results
In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases.
Conclusions
Using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time-efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical-thinking and fact-checking.}

Yet – to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the labs into the business reality – the challenge ahead is to substantially scale the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding thousands of fault-tolerant qubits. To this aim, the distributed quantum computing paradigm is recognized as the key solution for scaling the number of qubits. Indeed, accordingly to such a paradigm, multiple small-to-moderate-scale quantum processors communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks exceeding the computational power of single processing devices. The aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising with distributed quantum computing from a computer and communications engineering perspective. Furthermore, this survey provides an easy access and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results in the field.}

Through a series of in-depth interviews (n ​= ​20) with: clinicians, clinical researchers, data scientists, industry and support group representatives, we report stakeholder views regarding the adoption of this technology in a clinical setting. While most interviewees were supportive of employing CP as a diagnostic tool in some capacity we observed ambivalence around the potential for artificial intelligence to overcome diagnostic uncertainty in a clinical context. Thus, while there was widespread agreement amongst interviewees concerning the public benefits of AI assisted diagnosis, namely, its potential to increase diagnostic yield and enable faster more objective and accurate diagnoses by up skilling non specialists and thereby enabling access to diagnosis that is potentially lacking, interviewees also raised concerns about ensuring algorithmic reliability, expunging algorithmic bias and that the use of AI could result in deskilling the specialist clinical workforce. We conclude that, prior to widespread clinical implementation, on-going reflection is needed regarding the trade-offs required to determine acceptable levels of bias and conclude that diagnostic AI tools should only be employed as an assistive technology within the dysmorphology clinic.}

At the conclusion of the course, students expressed a preference for using traditional triangle congruence criteria (SAS, ASA, SSS, and AAS) over using transformations to complete proofs, but were nevertheless generally successful in completing proofs using transformations. Similarly, while the students often described thinking of transformations in terms of analytic forms, they were successfully able to prove triangle congruences in synthetic contexts. Finally, some evidence indicates that students may have motion or process conceptions of transformations, but not map or object conceptions, but this evidence is not conclusive.}

Bioinspired composite materials offer several advantages by mimicking the structure of natural counterparts. However, their complex hierarchical structure, compared to the limited number of observations, makes it difficult to extract all the structural features and vary the structure to optimize the materials’ functions without losing their natural features. We applied generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to design composites inspired by animal skin patterns, leveraging a small dataset to generate diverse configurations that closely emulate natural designs. Our computational simulations investigated the structure-mechanics relationship in these materials, revealing significant variations in mechanical functions and identifying patterns that exhibited superior mechanical properties. We validated these outstanding configurations’ performance through tensile tests on specimens produced by a multimaterial printer. We showcase GenAI’s role in structural augmentation that can yield rational bioinspired designs, complemented by an educational web page with interactive games for public access.}

abstract = {High precision and low complexity control algorithm plays an important role in the developing of the end-effector instrumentation of different robot manipulators. In order to reduce the kinetic energy and the high-speed drift phenomenon of the repetitive motion tracking task, the robot manipulator needs to calibrate its configuration. In this paper, we formulate the configuration calibration of the robot manipulator for the repetitive motion task as a future quadratic programming optimization problem constrained with equality constraints, which is also regarded as a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and modern control engineering. Zhang neural network, which is a canonical method, can be adopted to deal with the continuous form of the future optimization problem, named as temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints. In order to overcome the issue of temporally dependent inverse computing, a novel Zhang neural network model and its uncertain disturbance tolerant model, which are termed as filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model, respectively, are proposed by integrating the energy-type cost function and Zhang neural network design formula for solving the temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints in this paper. Based on the Euler discrete formula and the models, the discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network and the discrete uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms are proposed for solving the future quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the robot manipulator configuration calibration problem of repetitive motion. The convergence properties of the reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and its corresponding uncertain disturbance tolerant model are obtained by Lyapunov stability theory of nonlinear system and its corresponding perturbed system, while the convergence property of the filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model is analyzed by the limit thinking. For the repetitive motion task, three experiments for solving the configuration calibration problem of PUMA560, Kinova Jaco2, and Franka Emika Panda robot manipulators are performed to illustrate the effectiveness, robustness and superiority of our proposed discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms.}

Among other things, solving the equivalent dual ridge problem is computationally very fast even in high dimensions, and the crucial ‘amount of time variation’ is tuned by cross-validation. Evolving volatility is dealt with using a two-step ridge regression. I consider extensions that incorporate sparsity (the algorithm selects which parameters vary and which do not) and reduced-rank restrictions (variation is tied to a factor model). To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, I use it to study the evolution of monetary policy in Canada using large time-varying local projections and TVP-VARs with demanding lag lengths. The applications require the estimation of up to 4600 TVPs, a task within the reach of the new method.}

First, we have given the basic rules and algorithmic framework of CG and designed three kinds of growth and extinction rules respectively. Then, the three evolutionary rules for cellular within a single cycle are analyzed separately for form and ordering. The best expressions for the cellular jealous neighbor rule and the solitary regeneration rule are given, and the most appropriate order in which the rules are run is selected. Finally, the solution results of the cellular gradient algorithm and other classical optimization design algorithms are compared with a multi-objective multi-parameter mechanical optimization design problem as an example. The computational results show that the cellular gradient algorithm has an advantage over other algorithms in solving global and dynamic mechanical optimal design problems. The novelty of CG is to provide a new way of thinking for solving optimization problems with global discontinuities.}

abstract = {An oxymoron is a linguistic phenomenon in which a pair of opposite or antonymous words are combined to convey a new meaning. Sometimes, it is used to express figurative, irony, or rhetoric within the text. This issue has received relatively less attention in the realms of linguistics and computational disciplines. Oxymorons play a significant role in various language-processing applications. This study represents a pioneering effort in the exploration of oxymorons in the Bengali language. A corpus-based study of oxymoron is a fundamental issue that has not been explored so far. A system has been proposed for the automated recognition of oxymorons from a given corpus. Frequency analysis, semantic similarity, and an antonym dictionary have been employed to discern oxymorons within the corpus. The system achieved promising results when tested on a Bengali corpus, and found 308 distinct oxymorons. A corpus-based descriptive statistics is measured in two different corpora. The most common oxymorons are ranked based on their frequency. Their notable presence underscores the importance of the Bengali language. This study aimed to explore fundamental questions concerning oxymorons, such as the automated detection of oxymorons within a corpus, descriptive statistics regarding oxymorons across languages, and the process of their construction and creation. Additionally, efforts were made to extract oxymorons from large language models using zero-shot prompts, but the results were not as promising compared to our proposed system.}

abstract = {In meditation practices that involve focused attention to a specific object, novice practitioners often experience moments of distraction (i.e., mind wandering). Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of mind wandering during meditation practice through Electroencephalography (EEG) using linear metrics (e.g., oscillatory power). However, their results are not fully consistent. Since the brain is known to be a chaotic/nonlinear system, it is possible that linear metrics cannot fully capture complex dynamics present in the EEG signal. In this study, we assess whether nonlinear EEG signatures can be used to characterize mind wandering during breath focus meditation in novice practitioners. For that purpose, we adopted an experience sampling paradigm in which 25 participants were iteratively interrupted during meditation practice to report whether they were focusing on the breath or thinking about something else. We compared the complexity of EEG signals during mind wandering and breath focus states using three different algorithms: Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and Sample entropy (SampEn). Our results showed that EEG complexity was generally reduced during mind wandering relative to breath focus states. We conclude that EEG complexity metrics are appropriate to disentangle mind wandering from breath focus states in novice meditation practitioners, and therefore, they could be used in future EEG neurofeedback protocols to facilitate meditation practice.}

Huge, combinatorial, make-on-demand chemical spaces with high probability of synthetic success rise exponentially in content, generative machine learning models go hand in hand with synthesis prediction, and DNA-encoded libraries offer new ways of hit structure discovery. These technologies enable to search for new chemical matter in a much broader and deeper manner with less effort and fewer financial resources. These transformational developments require new cheminformatics approaches to make huge chemical spaces searchable and analyzable with low resources, and with as little energy consumption as possible. Substantial progress has been made in the past years with respect to computation as well as organic synthesis. First examples of bioactive compounds resulting from the successful use of these novel technologies demonstrate their power to contribute to tomorrow's drug discovery programs.

From the moment of conception, a process of neurodevelopment and complexification begins, generating and supporting a neuroelectric field that can be quantified by computational methods from dynamical systems theory. In the early embryo, genetically driven cellular processes are mediated by endogenous electromagnetic fields and intrinsic electrical fields produced by migrating neurons. In the ambient cellular environment, these interactions influence each other, impacting neural migration. The emergence of Theory of Mind, often considered a hallmark of conscious awareness, is accompanied by increasing neural connectivity, neuroelectric field complexity, and more integrated information processing. Neurodegeneration in old age and the often-associated decline in conscious awareness correlate closely with changes in the dynamical complexity of the neuroelectric field. Monitoring trajectories of the neuroelectric field and its complexity changes through the lifespan presents a developmental perspective and empirical correlation for studying the emergence and decline of human consciousness.}

In fact, although described by the constants of motion (Noether invariants) associated with space-time translations, they depend non-trivially on the parameters of the rotation subgroup. However, once the momentum space is parametrized by the Noether invariants, it behaves as that of ordinary particles. On the other hand, the evolution parameter is no longer the one associated with time translation, whose Noether invariant, Po, is now a basic one. Evolution takes place in a spatial direction. These facts not only make difficult the computation of the corresponding representation, but also force us to a sound revision of several traditional ingredients related to Cauchy hypersurface, scalar product and, of course, causality. After that, the theory becomes consistent and could shed new light on some special physical situations like inflation or traveling inside a black hole.}

AI-based RNN models are employed to simulate and forecast the complex heat transfer behavior in these environments, offering a more precise and efficient analysis as compared to traditional numerical methods. The findings of the study highlights the intricate interactions among thermal radiation, porous media, and internal heat generation which plays an integral role in a number of industrial and engineering applications. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is validated to examine the temperature distribution efficiency in a new configuration of triangular, porous, moving fins. Various dimensionless parameters are analyzed for their impact on the effectiveness of portable, transparent, triangular fins. These parameters include permeability, radiation-conduction, Peclet number, thermo-geometric factors, convection-conduction, and surface temperature. The Lobatto III-A numerical technique for HTMPTHG is simulated computationally to provide the synthetic datasets. Then, the RNN supervised computational technique is applied to the generated datasets and the RNN outputs show negligible errors and closely align with numerical observations for all model variant. The effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is rigorously proved through extensive experiments, demonstrating iterative convergence curves for mean squared error, control metrics of optimization and error distribution via histograms.The mean absolute percent error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) are all nearly zero, while the coefficient of determination (R2) is close to 1.Furthermore, there is strong evidence of the prediction accuracy and dependability of the RNN in the regression results for the HTMPTHG model.}

Cultural influences may lead individuals to weigh epistemic and deontic obligations differently; developing possibility conceptions are therefore positioned to be affected by cultural surroundings. Across two studies, 251 U.S. and Chinese 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds sampled from major metropolitan areas in Texas and the Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guangdong Provinces judged the possibility of impossible, improbable, and ordinary events. Across cultures and ages, children judged ordinary events as possible and impossible events as impossible; cultural differences emerged in developing conceptions of improbable events. Whereas U.S. children became more likely to judge these events possible with age, Chinese children's judgments remained consistent with age: Chinese 4- to 8-year-olds judged these events to be possible ∼25% of the time. In Study 2, to test whether this difference was attributable to differential prioritization of epistemic versus deontic constraints, children also judged whether each event was an epistemic violation (i.e., required magic to happen) and a deontic violation (i.e., would result in someone getting in trouble). With age, epistemic judgments were increasingly predictive of possibility judgments for improbable events for U.S. children, and decreasingly so for Chinese children. Contrary to our predictions, deontic judgments were not predictive. We propose that cultural valuation of norms might shape children's developing intuitions about possibility. We discuss our findings in light of three accounts of possibility conceptions, suggesting ways to integrate cultural context into each.}

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become ubiquitous in biology. Recently, there has been a push for using scRNA-seq snapshot data to infer the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) steering cellular function. To date, this aspiration remains unrealized due to technical and computational challenges. In this work we focus on the latter, which is under-represented in the literature. We took a systemic approach by subdividing the GRN inference into three fundamental components: data pre-processing, feature extraction, and inference. We observed that the regulatory signature is captured in the statistical moments of scRNA-seq data and requires computationally intensive minimization solvers to extract it. Furthermore, current data pre-processing might not conserve these statistical moments. Although our moment-based approach is a didactic tool for understanding the different compartments of GRN inference, this line of thinking—finding computationally feasible multi-dimensional statistics of data—is imperative for designing GRN inference methods.}

A central principle in neuroscience is that neurons within the brain act in concert to produce perception, cognition, and adaptive behavior. Neurons are organized into specialized brain areas, dedicated to different functions to varying extents, and their function relies on distributed circuits to continuously encode relevant environmental and body-state features, enabling other areas to decode (interpret) these representations for computing meaningful decisions and executing precise movements. Thus, the distributed brain can be thought of as a series of computations that act to encode and decode information. In this perspective, we detail important concepts of neural encoding and decoding and highlight the mathematical tools used to measure them, including deep learning methods. We provide case studies where decoding concepts enable foundational and translational science in motor, visual, and language processing.}

Here we review previous computational models of chaperonin-mediated protein folding in the context of the two main hypotheses for chaperonin function: iterative annealing and landscape modulation. We then discuss new results pointing to the importance of solvent (a previously neglected factor) in chaperonin activity. We conclude with our views on the future role of simulation in studying chaperonin activity as well as protein folding in other biologically relevant confined contexts.}

A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology was proposed for study analysis, aided by views of experts with sufficient teaching experience in Nigerian business school programs. The results indicate that adequate budgetary allocations, technical competence, a sufficient level of privacy, and an effective government regulatory framework are the most important of the investigated pre-conditions. Additionally, the pedagogical use of social media in business school programs is more strongly associated with learning outcomes such as professionalism and strategic thinking, emotional intelligence, and social maturity.

Uncertain processing times are described by a large set of discrete scenarios, which is a type of big data. The objective is to minimize the schedule performance under the worst-case scenario. Identifying the worst-case scenario for each evaluated schedule is quite time-consuming in the situation that the scenario set size is large so that the objective evaluation might be computationally expensive. To handle this difficulty, three-way decision is used to preprocess the large-size scenario set to get a reduced scenario set so that the concept of surrogate worst-case scenario is adopted. A hybrid harmony search algorithm of combining three-island framework and the scenario-based local search is developed to solve the discussed problem. Based on the single-scenario knowledge of 2PFSP, a problem-specific scenario-dependent neighborhood structure is constructed under the surrogate worst-case scenario. An extensive experiment was carried out. The computational results show that the application of surrogate worst-case scenario based on three-way decision is effective in reducing the time consuming while keeping schedule performance evaluation. Being compared to the worst-case scenario objective evaluation, for an example in the case of the middle bad-scenario ratio, the surrogate worst-case scenario objective evaluation made the solution algorithm save 12.95 % in average CPU time for all instances while the relative performance difference is only 1.809 % in average. Being compared to possible alternative algorithms derived from the state-of-the-art algorithms, the developed algorithm is advantageous for the addressed problems.}

Reasonably formulating the computational task offloading strategy and the trajectory control of the UAV is crucial for the high-efficiency completion of the task. In this paper, a computational offloading and trajectory control system model for UAV-assisted MEC is proposed. We seek to maximize the user ratio of coverage by jointly optimizing computing offload scheduling and UAV trajectories. We propose an improved DDPG algorithm to optimize the objective function and achieve the optimal solution. Meanwhile, our algorithm can achieve an improvement in the user rate of coverage while avoiding obstacles as compared with baseline algorithms, AC, and DDPG.}

abstract = {Digitization and related facilities have enabled the thermal power generation enterprises to record real-time data of thermal power units. There are many data-driven applications based on real-time monitoring and operational data in power units, while limited studies lay on the operational improvements, especially on coal consumption prediction under all working conditions. We build an intelligent prediction model of coal consumption based on key features selection, working condition clustering, and regression analysis. We combine feature construction and feature selection methods to cope with the problem caused by directly specifying feature subset for model building of traditional prediction method, which may fall into the thinking pattern and miss potentially better feature subset. Besides, to cope with the different coal consumption under different working conditions, we apply cluster analysis to construct a sub-coal consumption prediction model for each cluster category. Numerical results show that compared with other methods, it has the advantages of lower regression error and moderate model complexity, which can provide efficient decision support for operational improvement in thermal power generation.}

abstract = {When we are unaware of the causes for the observed deviations, we are more likely to react. When we react or are unaware of problems, we fail. Increasing the effectiveness of quality control samples starts with addressing what we do not know about them. So, this chapter first clarifies what we want, then describes what we have, and lastly what can be done to fill the gaps. The development, validation, and application of the batch control spike is a great illustration highlighting the importance the quality of the performance feedback and learning capacity the control samples are supposed to provide. When done correctly—while contextually questioning the relevance and appropriateness of current operating criteria, imposed limits and standards—the introduction of the batch control spike allows a process of critical errors identification, compensation, and progressive elimination to take place so that at the end, no significant systematic errors remain. This fact is demonstrated using z-scores from multiple international round-robin studies. In the context of achieving accuracy, the batch control spike examines the relationships between the standards used, when they are spiked, how they are spiked, and their purpose, that is, it renders the technology-in-use (isotope dilution) transparent and keeps it honest. It is also an excellent teaching tool. It is a quality learning sample helping the transformation of our methods into “thinking tools.”}

In this context, the present study analyzes the modeling strategies of one of the most common TES systems: stratified thermal storage tanks. These systems are essential to many solar thermal installations and heat pumps, among other clean energy technologies. Three different one-dimensional tank models are compared by their computing speed and resilience to long time steps. Two of the models analyzed are numerical, one being explicit and the other one implicit, and the other is analytical. The models are validated against data from experiments carried out considering small-scale stratified tanks, showing that their performance can be improved by using the Advanced Flowrate Distribution (AFD) method. The results show that the analytical model maintains its accuracy with longer time steps and is robust against divergence. Conversely, the numerical models show equivalent performance for short time steps, while the computation time is reduced. Although the AFD method shows promising results by achieving an improvement of 43% in terms of Dynamic Time Warping, its parameter optimization must be generalized for different tank designs, flow rates, and temperatures.}

abstract = {Increased battery energy density is required to boost electric vehicle endurance; however, this also raises the possibility of thermal runaway and power battery explosion. Improving the cooling system performance requires optimization and enhancement of classical systems. Traditional design approaches struggle to simultaneously enhance multiple aspects of performance, while an optimization based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods is often inefficient. Therefore, by integrating a flow resistance network model (FRNM) with a weighted average optimization algorithm (INFO), an efficient optimization for the comprehensive performance of the system can be achieved. Five optimized systems under different airflow rates were obtained through optimization. A comparison with two existing systems validated the effectiveness of the optimized system. The results demonstrate that, compared to the two reference systems, the optimized system decreases the maximum temperature difference by 65.51 % and 39.07 %, respectively. Furthermore, the improvement in temperature uniformity is more significant, increasing by 63.76 % and 34.40 %, respectively.}

abstract = {Background
Creativity is the use of original ideas to accomplish something innovative. Previous research supports the notion that creativity is facilitated by an activation of the right and/or a deactivation of the left prefrontal cortex. In contrast, recent brain imaging studies suggest that creativity improves with left frontal activation.
Objective
The present study was designed to further elucidate the neural basis of and ways to modulate creativity, based on the modulation of prefrontal cortical activity through the non-invasive brain stimulation technique transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
Methods
Ninety healthy University students performed three tasks on major aspects of creativity: conceptual expansion (Alternate Uses Task, AUT), associative thinking (Compound Remote Associate Task, CRA), and set shifting ability (Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, WCST). Simultaneously, they received cathodal stimulation of the left and anodal stimulation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the reverse protocol, or sham stimulation.
Results
The main pattern of results was a superior performance with bilateral left cathodal/right anodal stimulation, and an inferior performance in the reversed protocol compared to sham stimulation. As a potential underlying physiological mechanism, resting state EEG beta power, indicative of enhanced cortical activity, in the right frontal area increased with anodal stimulation and was associated with better performance.
Conclusion
The findings provide new insights into ways of modulating creativity, whereby a deactivation of the left and an activation of the right prefrontal cortex with tDCS is associated with increased creativity. Potential future applications might include tDCS for patients with mental disorders and for healthy individuals in creative professions.}

Design comprises a complex set of activities today involving both man and machine. Sustainability is a fundamental paradigm and carries significance in any process, natural or manmade, and its outcome. In simple terms, sustainability implies a state of sustainable living, viz. health and continuity, nurtured by diversity and evolution (innovations) in an ever-changing world. Design, in a similar line, has been comprehensively investigated and its current manifestations including design-aids (Computer Aided Design) have been evaluated in terms of sustainability. The paper investigates the rationale of sustainability to design as a whole – its purpose, its adoption in the natural world, its relevance to humankind and the technologies involved. Throughout its history, technology has been used to aid design. But in the current context of advanced algorithms and computational capacity, design no longer remains an exclusively animate faculty. Given this scenario, investigating sustainability in the light of advanced design aids such as CAD becomes pertinent. Considering that technology plays a part in design activities, the paper explores where technology must play a part and to what degree amongst the various activities that comprise design. The study includes an examination of the morphology of design and the development of a systems-thinking integrated forecasting model to evaluate the implications of CAD tools in design and sustainability. The results of the study along with a broad range of recommendations have been presented.}

abstract = {Stereoscopic depth perception is a fascinating ability in its own right and also a useful model of perception. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the early cortical circuitry underlying this ability. Inputs from left and right eyes are first combined in primary visual cortex (V1), where many cells are tuned for binocular disparity. Although the observation of disparity tuning in V1, combined with psychophysical evidence that stereopsis must occur early in visual processing, led to initial suggestions that V1 was the neural correlate of stereoscopic depth perception, more recent work indicates that this must occur in higher visual areas. The firing of cells in V1 appears to depend relatively simply on the visual stimuli within local receptive fields in each retina, whereas the perception of depth reflects global properties of the stimulus. However, V1 neurons appear to be specialized in a number of respects to encode ecologically relevant binocular disparities. This suggests that they carry out essential pre-processing underlying stereoscopic depth perception in higher areas. This article reviews recent progress in developing accurate models of the computations carried out by these neurons. We seem close to achieving a mathematical description of the initial stages of the brain's stereo algorithm. This is important in itself––for instance, it may enable improved stereopsis in computer vision––and paves the way for a full understanding of how depth perception arises.}

abstract = {While the ecoregional lake nutrient criteria have been widely used in the past two decades, the overconfidence on their applicability may mislead the pollution management decisions, considering the spatial heterogeneity within the ecoregion. The exploration of applicability is thereby important, but is hindered by the difficulty in recognizing reliable relationship patterns between the nutrient and management endpoint. We propose a novel relationship-based clustering approach (RCA) to explore whether the ecoregional scale is precise enough for nutrient criteria. The approach (a) simulates relationships using Bayesian Linear Models, (b) clusters lakes according to relationship similarities via relationship mapping and hierarchical clustering, and (c) identifies reliable relationship patterns based on the leave-one-out cross-validation. The RCA is then employed to explore Chlorophyll a-total phosphorus relationships of 34 lakes in four Ecological Drainage Units (EDUs) in the U.S. Long-term water quality data is from a newly established database (LAGOS-NE). The results show that multiple relationship patterns exist in all the EDUs. The ecoregional relationships misestimate the nutrient effect in over a half of lakes. Therefore, we determine that the ecoregional scale is not precise enough for nutrient criteria and the sub-ecoregional scale is then recommended. Besides, the RCA provides a backward thinking for determining the spatial scale and can be used in some other fields where relationship-based clustering is needed.}
