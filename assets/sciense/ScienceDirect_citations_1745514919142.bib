abstract = {Internet+ecosystems, big data applications, customers’ specific demands, and internal and external values integration of enterprises pose new challenges to inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. To confront these challenges, this paper integrates computational experiment and data analysis, and proposes a methodology for data-driven computational experiments for inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. It explores a paradigm shift to the development of data-driven computational experiments that supports decision making in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations. A basic principle for integrated solutions generation in the parallel worlds of virtual reality interaction is studied and the corresponding key issues in the paradigm are analyzed. To support the paradigm and solve key issues, a six-layered framework with four viewpoints for data-driven computational experiments is proposed. This framework systematically presents conceptual and technical solutions for data-driven computational experiments and decision support in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. The effectiveness of the framework is verified by theoretical analysis and a case study.}

The importance of culturing and nourishing this individual to not only reach its potential but to pass its selected genetics on to progeny is paramount. Thus, all the investment in genetic improvement is now at the mercy of management. Once the goats are in the herd on the farm and the responsibility of the farmer or farm manager, the expression and proliferation of the genotype will be strongly influenced by environmental factors. If maximum milk production per lactation were the real and only goal that could promise farm business and land sustainability, genetic selection would be easy. However, the real goal on farms is to have healthy goats that produce efficiently and are adapted to their environment. This places the development of the goat breeding program in the hands of farmers. To aid farmers in moving beyond the use of total milk production per goat as the feedback mechanism to farm sustainability, the integration of more appropriate progress indicators could include longevity (which, in humans, is estimated at 20% genetic and 80% environmental), the amount of milk or milk component production per body weight of goat, and the degree of involuntary culling.}

However, interoperability challenges between retailer organizations and manufacturers present a barrier to decision-making processes and impact the human-centric nature of the IoV. Ethical dilemmas arise as a result of the IoV’s inability to prevent accidents, particularly in critical situations. This study aims to enhance the IoV’s effectiveness by carefully selecting and improving essential attributes from various data sources, including sensors, GPS, 5G or 6G communication networks, and real-time data provisioning. To achieve the aim of the proposed study, a Multi-criterion Decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, which allows for the analysis and selection of optimal choices while taking into account various quantitative and qualitative factors. Despite the challenges posed by complex models and ambiguous data, MCDM remains an indispensable technique for aligning transportation systems with current expectations. The CRITIC and TOPSIS MCDM-enabled methodologies are employed to analyze IoV architecture, prioritizing significant elements that impact system performance and identifying optimal solutions by considering complications from worst-case scenarios. The study will assist engineers, scientists, and organizations to develop smart IoV systems that will cater to human needs by improving mobility and inspiration among users.}

The findings provide novel evidence for multimodal theories of enriched learning, challenge assumptions of longstanding cognitive theories, and provide counterevidence to unimodal neurobiologically inspired theories. Enriched educational methods are likely effective not only because they may engage greater levels of attention or deeper levels of processing, but also because multimodal interactions in the brain can enhance learning and memory.}

It is therefore a promising innovation for increasing design process productivity through the adaptability of the aggregations it generates. In the built environment, discrete design is usually identified with the modular method. It is a construction process based on the aggregation of different modules assembled according to well-defined connections to ensure the building’s integrity and functionality. It involves off-site manufacturing, and hence a controlled environment ensuring more predictability over weathering and change. But like in conventional construction practices, the fragmentation of modular construction processes hinders its productivity. As a result, this construction approach requires adequate technologies and communication tools to improve collaboration and productivity. This paper aims to address these requirements by adopting a BIM-driven computational approach to design processes and a robotic approach to prefabrication processes. It proposes a modular construction framework for design and production, and presents the results through a study adopting BIM-driven discrete design and robotic manufacturing.}

abstract = {This paper makes a novel linkage between the multiple-computations theorem in philosophy of mind and Landauer's principle in physics. The multiple-computations theorem implies that certain physical systems implement simultaneously more than one computation. Landauer's principle implies that the physical implementation of “logically irreversible” functions is accompanied by minimal entropy increase. We show that the multiple-computations theorem is incompatible with, or at least challenges, the universal validity of Landauer's principle. To this end we provide accounts of both ideas in terms of low-level fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics, thus providing a deeper understanding of these ideas than their standard formulations given in the high-level terms of thermodynamics and cognitive science. Since Landauer's principle is pivotal in the attempts to derive the universal validity of the second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics, our result entails that the multiple-computations theorem has crucial implications with respect to the second law. Finally, our analysis contributes to the understanding of notions, such as “logical irreversibility,” “entropy increase,” “implementing a computation,” in terms of fundamental physics, and to resolving open questions in the literature of both fields, such as: what could it possibly mean that a certain physical process implements a certain computation.}

abstract = {This article introduces differentiated creative search (DCS), a groundbreaking optimization algorithm that revolutionizes traditional decision-making systems in complex environments. In contrast to conventional differential evolution methods, DCS integrates a unique knowledge-acquisition process with a creative realism paradigm, thereby transforming optimization strategies. The primary aim of DCS is to enhance decision-making efficacy by employing a newly proposed dual-strategy approach that balances divergent and convergent thinking within a team-based framework. High-performing members apply divergent thinking via the DCS/Xrand/Linnik(α,σ) strategy, which incorporates existing knowledge and Linnik flights. Conversely, the remaining team harnesses convergent thinking through the DCS/Xbest/Current-to-2rand strategy, which combines insights from both the team leader and fellow members. This division of labor, coupled with a strategy tailored to the performance levels of team members, allows for a dynamic and effective decision-making process. The methodology of DCS involves iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, supported by a differentiated knowledge-acquisition process and retrospective assessments. The algorithm's novelty lies in its differentiated knowledge-acquisition, adjusted based on individual team member performance, fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. The paper's contributions are demonstrated through rigorous testing of DCS on various benchmark functions, including CEC2017, classical, and sensor selection problems, as well as real-world applications such as car side impact design, gear train design, and FM sound wave parameter estimation. The results showcase the promising performance of DCS compared to that of existing algorithms, attributable to its innovative approach to problem solving and decision making in complex scenarios. The results and impact section highlights that DCS considerably outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, offering a robust and versatile tool for complex decision-making systems. Its impact is particularly notable in scenarios requiring a balance between innovative solutions and practical decision-making, making DCS a valuable asset in strategic planning and execution across various industries.}

abstract = {An analytical and adaptive parameter extraction method is proposed to accurately and efficiently extract the parameters of solar cells' triple-diode lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model. This method can obtain explicit expressions of parameters, facilitating seamless integration into photovoltaic systems for circuit-level simulation and design. The proposed method addresses the lack of analytical parameter extraction methods for triple-diode model, avoids the iteration of numerical methods, and significantly reduces computational complexity, thus improving the overall efficiency of the modeling process. In this method, the principle of effective-diode-based analysis is used to simplify the complex multi-diode model. Recursive thinking is then combined to adaptively extract all parameters through multiple steps according to the number of diodes in the model. Subsequently, the practicability of this method is evaluated by testing on three different equivalent circuit models of solar cells including the single-, double-, and triple-diode models. Furthermore, the universality of this method is demonstrated by testing on three photovoltaic modules of different types including Mono-crystalline, Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and perovskite solar cells at different temperatures and irradiances. Finally, the simulation results based on the extracted parameters are compared with the experimental data to calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) magnitude, which ranges from 10−5 to 10−3, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. As a result, this analytical parameter extraction method provides a robust tool and approach for research and applications in the field of solar cell modeling.}

The search engines used were Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and other journal databases including ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor & Francis etc. for papers published between 2010 and 2024. These searches yielded 2352 peer-reviewed articles. The application of the selection and rejection criteria led to the formation of a shortlisting 32 papers, following the initial evaluation. The findings revealed the various approaches that teachers can employ during play sessions with STEM toys while teaching. Kindergarten teachers take on the roles of facilitators and mediators, promote collaborative work, and encourage children to perform experiments and learn from failure. Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that kindergarten teachers generally maintain favourable and constructive perspectives regarding the utilisation of STEM toys. The results underscore positive impacts on cognitive abilities of children like problem-solving and critical thinking, and socio-emotional skills like verbal communication from using STEM toys. Comprehensive teacher training is emphasised to identify methodologies that complement the technology, maximizing teaching-learning benefits for children's brain development.}

To assess the viability of this scenario, we first review how a local cortical patch may be modeled as an attractor network, in which memory representations are not artificially stored as prescribed binary patterns of activity as in the Hopfield model, but self-organize as continuously graded patterns induced by afferent input. Recordings in macaques indicate that such cortical attractor networks may express retrieval dynamics over cognitively plausible rapid time scales, shorter than those dominated by neuronal fatigue. A cortical network encompassing many local attractor networks, and incorporating a realistic description of adaptation dynamics, may be captured by a Potts model. This network model has the capacity to engage long-range associations into sustained iterative attractor dynamics at a cortical scale, in what may be regarded as a mathematical model of spontaneous lateral thought.

In the United States, caregivers of people living with Alzheimer disease and Alzheimer disease–related dementias (AD/ADRD) provide >16 billion hours of unpaid care annually. These caregivers experience high levels of stress and burden related to the challenges associated with providing care. Social media is an emerging space for individuals to seek various forms of support.
Objective
We aimed to explore the primary topics of conversation on the social media site Reddit related to AD/ADRD. We then aimed to explore these topics in depth, specifically examining elements of social support and behavioral symptomology discussed by users.
Methods
We first generated an unsupervised topic model from 6563 posts made to 2 dementia-specific subreddit forums (r/Alzheimers and r/dementia). Then, we conducted a manual qualitative content analysis of a random subset of these data to further explore salient themes in the corpus.
Results
The topic model with the highest overall coherence score (0.38) included 10 topics, including caregiver burden, anxiety, support-seeking, and AD/ADRD behavioral symptomology. Qualitative analyses provided added context, wherein users sought emotional and informational support for many aspects of the care experience, including assistance in making key care-related decisions. Users expressed challenging and complex emotions on Reddit, which may be taboo to express in person.
Conclusions
Reddit users seek many different forms of support, including emotional and specific informational support, from others on the internet. Users expressed a variety of concerns, challenges, and behavioral symptoms to manage as part of the care experience. The unique (ie, anonymous and moderated) nature of the forum allowed for a safe space to express emotions free from documented caregiver stigma. Additional support structures are needed to assist caregivers of people living with AD/ADRD.}

According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.}

Python was utilized to gather online textual data from Chinese and North American travellers, while word frequency analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling analysis and content analysis were employed to elucidate the perception styles in a cross-cultural context. In general, North American travellers mainly leaned towards analytic thinking, whereas Chinese travellers showcased a blend of holistic and analytic thought processes. The topic of travel, leisure and accommodation showed both holistic and analytic thinking styles. The topics of nature and environment, front desk service, and travel routes and scenic spot areas mainly represented a holistic thinking style. The topics of convenience and facilities, breakfast, transportation, hotel theme and features, and decoration and amenities mainly suggested an analytic thinking style. Hotels should consider the different perception styles of Chinese and North American travellers to facilitate strategies accordingly and to maximize the experience of travellers from different cultural backgrounds.}

It starts by classifying different types of functionally graded (FG) materials such as conventional, axial, bi-directional, and tri-directional, and the material distribution models like power-law, exponential, trigonometric, polynomial functions, etc. It also discusses the application of advanced size-dependent theories like Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity, nonlocal strain gradient, modified couple stress, and consistent couple stress theories, which are essential to predict the behavior of structures at small scales. The review covers the mechanical analysis of MDFG nanostructures in nanobeams, nanopipes, nanoplates, and nanoshells and their dynamic and static responses under different loading conditions. The effect of multi-directional material gradation on stiffness, stability and vibration is discussed. Moreover, the review highlights the need for more advanced analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods to solve the complex vibration problems of MDFG nanostructures. It is evident that the continued development of these methods is crucial for the design, optimization, and real-world application of MDFG nanostructures in advanced engineering fields like aerospace, biomedicine, and micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). This study is a reference for researchers and engineers working in the domain of MDFG nanostructures.}

The proposed BCM implements with the two main steps. First, we combine free energy principle and sparse perception mechanism to achieve the goal of only using extremely few reference for assessing the image quality. Second, we further introduce the attention perception mechanism to boost the assessment performance by improving the sparse perception mechanism mentioned above. Based on the most commonly used image quality database, it was found that our proposed model has derived higher performance than the peer extremely few reference IQA models and competitive performance as compared with the benchmark full reference IQA models.}

Scotland is no exception and MSP is central to its management plans. The interpretation and use of spatial data informs these plans and maps provide the backbone of the decision-making process. Whilst not refuting MSP as a governance tool, this paper examines more closely some of the inherent problems with representing marine environments spatially and how the practice of map-making inevitably interacts with social-ecological networks. Borrowing from critical cartography and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), four observations are made: 1) due to the necessary procedure of categorising and simplifying data, maps do not always accurately represent changeable marine environments and situations; 2) maps can produce reality as much as represent it; 3) mapping has become the point through which all actors and stakeholders must pass; 4) as they are obliged to pass through this point, the roles and definition of certain actors can change. This discussion of marine spatial planning in Scotland demonstrates what can be learnt from viewing marine spaces as a tightly coupled social-ecological environment.}

While past work has emphasized the information value of direct social interactions (such as watching someone help or hinder others), social tendencies can also be inferred from indirect evidence, such as how an agent considers others when making personal choices. Here we present a computational model of this capacity, grounded in a Bayesian framework for action understanding. Across four experiments we show that this model captures how people infer social preferences based on how agents act when their choices indirectly impact others (Experiments 1a, 1b, & 1c), and how people infer what an agent knows about others from knowledge of that agent’s social preferences (Experiment 2). Critically, people’s patterns of inferences could not be explained by simpler alternatives. These findings illuminate how people can discern potential social partners from indirect evidence of their prosociality, thus deepening our understanding of partner detection, and social cognition more broadly.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students' engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI's ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking.}

The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions.}

abstract = {Research in computational psychiatry is dominated by models of behavior. Subjective experience during behavioral tasks is not well understood, even though it should be relevant to understanding the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior. When smartphone tasks are collected longitudinally, subjective feelings provide a potential means to bridge the gap between lab-based behavioral tasks and real-life behavior, emotion, and psychiatric symptoms.}

Neurophysiological evidence suggests that oscillatory alpha activity is correlated with visual-figurative creative thinking. However, whether alpha oscillations play a functional role in generating graphic symbols remains unclear. To address this issue, we compared the EEG alpha power of 40 healthy adults while ideating creative and conventional graphic symbols representing an abstract concept’s meaning (e.g., the word ’peace’). Our results revealed that the ideation of graphic symbols elicited alpha synchronization, with higher levels in the conventional compared to the creative condition, mainly over frontal-central, frontal-temporal, parietal-occipital, and occipital regions. Furthermore, we observed greater alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere than in the left across both conditions, particularly between temporal, central-parietal, and parietal electrodes. This asymmetry extended to central electrodes in the creative condition, while in the conventional condition, it was more pronounced over parietal-occipital regions. Finally, we also found that frontal and occipital alpha synchronization during the creative ideation phase predicted the subsequent originality scores of the graphic symbols produced. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of the dynamics of oscillatory alpha activity during graphic symbol creation, shedding light on how the interaction between inhibitory top-down control mechanisms and cognitive flexibility processes facilitates the transformation of abstract concepts into visual forms. These findings provide new insights into the neural processes underlying this uniquely human ability.}

Classical philosophy of formal languages as well as symbolic AI assume that all kinds of knowledge must explicitly be represented by formal or programming languages. This assumption is limited by recent insights into the biology of evolution and developmental psychology of the human organism. Most of our knowledge is implicit and unconscious. It is not formally represented, but embodied knowledge, which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with changing environments. That is true not only for low-level skills, but even for high-level domains of categorization, language, and abstract thinking. The embodied mind is considered an emergent capacity of the brain as a self-organizing complex system. Actually, self-organization has been a successful strategy of evolution to handle the increasing complexity of the world. Genetic programs are not sufficient and cannot prepare the organism for all kinds of complex situations in the future. Self-organization and emergence are fundamental concepts in the theory of complex dynamical systems. They are also applied in organic computing as a recent research field of computer science. Therefore, cognitive science, AI, and robotics try to model the embodied mind in an artificial evolution. The paper analyzes these approaches in the interdisciplinary framework of complex dynamical systems and discusses their philosophical impact.}

The most characterising and critical step along the Design Thinking process is the empathy phase, in which stakeholder analysis is performed by looking at a given scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders. Such a methodology enables a systematic information gathering and organization that results in a deep understanding of actual problems, needs and expectations from the target stakeholders. The uniqueness of problems and the need for situation-specific data makes knowledge re-use not always practical, even within the most consolidated and experienced environments. In this paper we propose an ontological support to empathy mapping that aims to (i) establish an interoperable fine-grained data layer among the different data collected throughout the empathy mapping process, (ii) enable multi-scenario analysis underpinned by formal specifications and (iii) further empower the process through semantic enrichment and integration of insight from multiple sources and contexts. We believe this is the first step to design and properly integrate effective computational and AI-based functionalities along the creative design thinking process, as well as to enable in practice richer and more sophisticated approaches (e.g. through social networks).}

Counterfactual thinking may play a role in various cognitive phenomena in disordered gambling, such as the effects of near-misses. This study compared individuals with gambling disorder (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 25) on a behavioural economic choice task that entailed choosing between two gambles, designed to measure counterfactual thinking. Participants provided affect ratings following both the obtained and the non-obtained outcomes. Choices were analyzed using a computational model that derived parameters reflecting sensitivity to expected value, risk variance, and anticipated regret. In the computational choice model, the group with gambling disorder showed increased sensitivity to anticipated regret, reduced sensitivity to expected value, and increased preference for high risk-variance gambles. On the affect ratings, the group with gambling disorder displayed blunted emotional sensitivity to obtained and counterfactual outcomes. Effect sizes of the group differences were modest. Participants with gambling disorder show wide-ranging alterations in decision-making processes and emotional reactivity to choice outcomes. Altered sensitivity to anticipatory regret in gambling disorder may contribute to the development of gambling-related cognitive distortions, and the influences of gambling marketing.}

By choosing to highlight similarities, we focus on general concepts in spatial inference, and often defer details of several interesting and current threads of development to the relevant literature. We conclude with a listing of some of these developing areas of interest and references for further reading.}

abstract = {Research has shown that solving counting problems correctly can be difficult for students at all levels, and mathematics educators have sought to identify strategies and interventions to help students reason conceptually about combinatorial tasks. A set-oriented perspective (Lockwood, 2014) is a way of thinking about counting problems that emphasizes the importance of reasoning about the set of outcomes being counted. From a set-oriented perspective, one possible type of intervention is to have students focus on the sets of outcomes rather than formulas and expressions, and specifically to reason about the structure of the set of outcomes. Yet, reasoning about sets of outcomes is not sufficient for students to make connections between outcomes and counting processes. In this paper, we investigate tasks where students wrote computer code to enumerate the set of outcomes in a specific order by implementing listing processes, and they were then asked to determine a specific numbered outcome in their list by using the structure of their enumeration scheme. We clarify particular aspects of a set-oriented perspective that were productive for students, and we demonstrate that tasks that asked students to name a specific outcome in their list elicited meaningful connections between counting processes and sets of outcomes. Further, such tasks reinforce desirable mathematical practices such as leveraging structure and connecting representations.}

With specific focus on the LVTS, the paper presents a structural model where the payments system represents a market in which bilateral credit limits are the pricing mechanisms for intraday liquidity provisioning and the credit risk arising from the loss sharing arrangement. The data-driven stochastic game framework further illustrates how payments data, in conjunction with other financial market and credit data, can be used to assess emergent macroscopic outcomes in clearing and settlement systems from the underpinning interactions of autonomous decision making agents.

Learning in social interactions is critical for bond formation and acquiring knowledge. Importantly, this type of learning is typically bi-directional, as both partners learn about each other simultaneously. Here we review the literature on social learning and propose a new computational and neural model characterizing mutual predictions that take place within and between interactions. According to our model, each partner in the interaction attempts to minimize the prediction error of the self and the interaction partner. In most cases, these inferential models become similar over time, thus enabling mutual understanding to develop. At the neural level, this type of social learning may be supported by interbrain plasticity, defined as a change in interbrain coupling over time in neural networks associated with social learning, among them the mentalizing network, the observation-execution system, and the hippocampus. The mutual prediction model constitutes a promising means of providing empirically verifiable accounts of how relationships develop over time.}

abstract = {Students systematically and deliberately apply rule-based but erroneous algorithms to solving unfamiliar arithmetic problems. These algorithms result in erroneous solutions termed rational errors. Computationally, students' erroneous algorithms can be represented by perturbations or bugs in otherwise correct arithmetic algorithms (Brown & VanLehn, 1980; Langley & Ohilson, 1984; VanLehn, 1983, 1986, 1990; Young S O'Sheo, 1981). Bugs are useful for describing how rational errors occur but bugs are not sufficient for explaining their origin. A possible explanation for this is that rational errors are the result of incorrect induction from examples. This prediction is termed the “induction hypothesis” (VanLehn, 1986). The purpose of the present study was to: (a) expand on post formulations of the induction hypothesis, and (b) use a new methodology to test the induction hypothesis more carefully than has been done previously. The first step involved teaching participants a new number system called NewAbacus, a written modification of the abacus system. The second step consisted of dividing them into different groups, where each individual received an example of only one port of the NewAbacus addition algorithm. During the third and final step, participants were instructed to solve both familiar and unfamiliar types of addition problems in NewAbacus. The induction hypothesis was supported by using both empirical and computational investigations.}

In this respect, this mathematical framework offers a conceptual knowledge representation through the Galois lattice. This hierarchical conceptual structure has been beneficial within the task of knowledge discovery in databases. However, its effective use in large datasets is always limited by the overwhelming number of extracted formal concepts. To select interesting formal concepts, the stability measure can be of valuable help. The dedicated literature has highlighted non-scalable approaches to compute such a stability measure. In an effort to tackle this issue, we introduce the Dfsp algorithm dedicated to efficiently compute the quality measure of the stability of formal concepts. We also show that the stability computation is an instantiation of a larger issue: locating minimal generators given the closed pattern as a reference point. The guiding idea of the Dfsp algorithm is to maximize as far as possible the quantity of the useless search space through the swift localization of maximal non-generator cliques. The experiments performed demonstrate the efficiency of the Dfsp algorithm.}

The medial prefrontal cortex clearly distinguishes high level versus low level of strategic thinking, thus encoding the complexity underlying human social behavior.}

A corpus of 7879 research articles related to spatial perspectives on energy issues is processed and analyzed based on a step-by-step framework for the automated, transparent, and reproducible analysis of large sets of research articles. For this purpose, natural language processing approaches, including named entity recognition and structural topic modeling, are adopted. Based on this large-n selection procedure, selected topics related to the geographical political economy of the energy transition are reviewed in detail. The review maps the geographical scope and scale of the research field, highlights major topics, and shows the distribution of methodological approaches and the role of geographic information systems in this research field. The results show a growing body of literature attentive to socio-spatial variation and the uneven spatiality of energy systems. Nevertheless, uneven geographical distributions of studies with a strong focus on the major industrialized countries and generally only a few comparative cases were also found. In particular, research on the energy transition and renewable energy policy is strongly informed by studies addressing the Global North, limiting the evidence base for other regional contexts from the Global South.}

In this social neuroscience study, we scanned 121 vaccine-supporters using magnetoencephalography to evaluate three levels of polarisation: explicit, implicit, and neural — and then to test whether exposing people to extreme ingroup perspectives (following the paradoxical thinking principles) or extreme outgroup perspectives can modulate those levels of affective polarisation between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We show that a neural proxy for intergroup polarisation, expressed as late prefrontal beta rhythm suppression, can detect subtle changes in affective polarisation. More specifically, we find that exposing vaccine-supporters to extreme ingroup (i.e., pro-vaccination) viewpoints leads to a decrease in this neural proxy of affective polarisation. Conversely, exposure to extreme outgroup (i.e., anti-vaccination) narratives increases polarisation, which in turn predicts a decrease in positive affect towards vaccine opposers almost one year later. Altogether, the results show that although it may seem intuitive to expose people to counter-arguments (i.e., extreme outgroup perspectives) to change their opinions, such an approach can backlash and increase polarisation instead. However, using subtler methods such as the paradoxical thinking intervention (i.e., extreme ingroup perspectives) for attitude change can have the desired effects and reduce intergroup polarisation.}

They still lack the ‘magic’ of human-level cognition: systems built for one paradigm appear clueless outside of its boundary. Natural cognitive systems, on the other hand, can adapt to unexpected environments and paradigms. To capture the robustness of natural cognitive development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system, embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at different evolutionary levels and in different species are analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of activation during the incubation period increases creative abilities of the system. It is argued that the proposed approach can explain a range of facts and mysteries associated with the human cognitive ontogeny and can provide the basis for a self-sustained evolution of future Artificial Intelligence.}

This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. Implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital health technologies are increasingly used in the medical field. Despite promises of leading the future of personalised medicine and better clinical outcomes, implementation of AI faces barriers for deployment at scale. We introduce a novel implementation framework that can facilitate digital health designers, developers, patient groups, policymakers, and other stakeholders, to co-create and solve issues throughout the lifecycle of designing, developing, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining algorithmic models. This framework targets health systems that integrate multiple machine learning (ML) models with various modalities. This design thinking approach promotes clinical utility beyond model prediction, combining privacy-preservation with clinical parameters to establish a reward function for reinforcement learning, ranking competing models. This allows leveraging explainable AI (xAI) methods for clinical interpretability. Governance mechanisms and orchestration platforms can be integrated to monitor and manage models. The proposed framework guides users towards human-centred AI design and developing AI-enhanced health-system solutions.}

abstract = {Science and philosophy have long struggled with how to even begin studying the neural or computational basis of qualitative experience. Here I review psychological, neuroscience, and philosophical literature to reveal how perceptual metacognition possesses five unique properties that provide a powerful opportunity for studying the neural and computational correlates of subjective experience: (1) Metacognition leads to subjective experiences (we “feel” confident); (2) Metacognition is “about” internal representations, formalizing introspection; (3) Metacognitive computations are “recursive” (applying to meta-cognition and meta-meta-cognition), so we might discover “canonical computations” preserved across processing levels and implementations; (4) Metacognition is anchored to observable behavior; and (5) Metacognitive computations are unobservable yet hierarchically dependent, requiring development of sensitive, specific models. Given these properties, computational models of metacognition provide an empirically-tractable early step in characterizing the generative process that constructs qualitative experience. I also present practical ways to make progress in this vein, applying decades of developments in nearby fields to perceptual metacognition to reveal new and exciting insights about how the brain constructs subjective conscious experiences.}

This chapter focuses on harmonic mind and its structure, and its importance in everyday transfer thinking. The harmonic structure of higher level transfer thinking helps to efficiently store, integrate, remember, process, and retrieve information. Such a structure becomes a memory or mnemonic device for learning. This form of analogical transfer is also seen in the basic structure of higher level mathematical thinking. Thus it appears that transfer ability and mathematical ability are integrally related on some fundamental neurological level. Although analogical transfer ability, which is manifested mathematically in abstract proportional forms, is characteristic of all good mathematicians, those not skilled in higher mathematics may nevertheless be good at transfer thinking.}

Beliefs are conceptualized as unregulated conceptual structures, for the most part hypothetical and often fanciful or deluded. Thinking and reasoning on the other hand are seen as rational activities regulated by rules and governed by norms. Computational modeling of the mind has focused on rule-governed behavior, ultimately trying to reduce them to rules of logic. What if thinking is less like reasoning and more like believing? I argue that the classical model of thought as rational is mistaken and that thinking is fundamentally constituted by believing. This new approach forces us to re-evaluate classical epistemic concepts like “truth”, “justification” etc. Furthermore, if thinking is believing, then it is not clear how thoughts can be modeled computationally. We need new mathematical ideas to model thought, ideas that are quite different from traditional logic-based mathematical structures.}

abstract = {Physiological studies have shown that a group of locust’s lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) has a diversity of collision selectivity to approaching objects, relatively darker or brighter than their backgrounds in cluttered environments. Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.}

These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.}

Machine learning for anomaly detection plays an essential role in recognizing unexpected patterns or outliers in the data. Anomaly detection is an active research subject. This is important in areas such as information security, banking, medical care, and industrial monitoring. Anomaly detection is an important aspect of healthcare analytics. In reality, abnormal occurrences must be accurately identified with few false negative alarms, even when operating with high-noise data. This study aims to provide comprehensive information on different machine and deep learning models and their efficient utilization in detecting anomalies in health-related records. Furthermore, this chapter will analyze anomaly detection methods for significant diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and lung-related diseases. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of popular anomaly detection methods and, explore recent trends in anomaly detection.}

Bayesian and predictive processing are promising approaches for computational modeling of the “active self”. We evaluate their implementation and challenges in computational psychiatry and cognitive developmental robotics. We describe how and why embodied robotic systems provide a valuable tool in psychiatry to assess, validate, and simulate mechanisms of self-disorders. Specifically, mechanisms involving sensorimotor learning, prediction, and self-other distinction, can be assessed with artificial agents.

abstract = {High-quality mesh surfaces are crucial for geometric processing in a variety of applications. To generate these meshes, polyhedral remeshing techniques truncate Voronoi cells of the original surface and yield precise intersections, but the calculation is complicated. Some methods apply auxiliary points to construct Voronoi diagrams to simplify these techniques, thereby extracting co-planar facets to approximate the original surface. However, extracting these approximate facets from the constructed Voronoi diagram makes it inefficient and non-parallelizable. To this end, we propose an efficient GPU method for manifold surface remeshing, where the restricted tangent face (RTF) is utilized to approximate the original surface. By intersecting the pre-clipped Voronoi cell with the tangent plane, this method directly calculates the RTF of each point without any auxiliary points or traversing Voronoi cells. Moreover, to restrict the movement of points, we introduce a projection method based on the KNN strategy, where each point is projected onto the triangular facet in the original surface. Owing to the independence and non-interference of the RTF computation and projection of each point, our method is implemented in parallel on the GPU. Experimental results on various mesh surfaces demonstrate the superior performance of our method in the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency.}

In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.}

He named it Chaimatics and suggested its generalization to the ultimate all-encompassing theory that unites biology, physics and mathematics. He made a number of experimental discoveries, including color coding in the retina, the participation mechanisms of Ca2+ ions in synaptic transmission, and the measurement of potential in the coupling membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. He also made a decisive contribution to the proof of the chemiosmotic hypothesis of oxidative phosphorylation. In a series of works started in 1972, Liberman developed the concept of the molecular computer of the cell, which includes the programs written on DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences and executed by enzymes playing the role of processing units whereas nucleotide sequences are interpreted as commands and addresses. In this framework, Liberman predicted RNA splicing before its discovery and suggested the role of processing of small informational molecules (later defined as small RNAs) in controlling biological processes. Efim Liberman defined the fundamental property of life as a molecular and quantum computational system and introduced the idea of quantum computing inside a cell for making decisions on complex control tasks described by equations of mathematical physics. He approached the brain as a net of molecular computers and created a model of neuron operation based on the transmission of hypersound signals via cytoskeleton where the molecular computational system encodes the digital output. In 1979 Liberman published a hypothesis of human self-consciousness associated with not a chemical, but with a physical quantum coherent system and named it “extremal quantum regulator”. We review here the contributions of Liberman in understanding the mechanisms of intracellular processing of information and his efforts to create an integrative theory of natural computation that aims to unite biology, physics and mathematics.}

However, current formulation development still relies on traditional trial-and-error experiments, which are time-consuming, costly, and unpredictable. With the exponential growth of computing capability and algorithms, in recent ten years, a new discipline named “computational pharmaceutics” integrates with big data, artificial intelligence, and multi-scale modeling techniques into pharmaceutics, which offered great potential to shift the paradigm of drug delivery. Computational pharmaceutics can provide multi-scale lenses to pharmaceutical scientists, revealing physical, chemical, mathematical, and data-driven details ranging across pre-formulation studies, formulation screening, in vivo prediction in the human body, and precision medicine in the clinic. The present paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review in all areas of computational pharmaceutics and “Pharma 4.0”, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, molecular modeling, mathematical modeling, process simulation, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.

Children also completed a visual pattern extension task and a verbal working memory task. There were four key findings: (1) children with DLD exhibited poorer mathematical knowledge than typically-developing children, both in calculation and on key math concepts, (2) children with DLD performed similarly to typically-developing children on the visual pattern extension task, (3) children with DLD had lower verbal working memory scores than typically-developing children, and these differences in working memory accounted in part for their poorer calculation performance, and (4) children’s pattern extension scores predicted their arithmetic calculation scores, but not their concept scores.}

abstract = {Coreless filament winding extends established industrial processes, enabling the fabrication of building parts with minimal formwork. Since the part's final geometry is unknown until completed, it creates uncertainties for design and engineering. Existing architectural design workflows are insufficient, and industrial software packages cannot capture the complexity of self-deforming fibres to model complex fibre layups. This research introduces a feedback-based computational method conceived as four development cycles to design and evaluate fibre layups of large-scale architectural building components, and a multi-scalar digital-physical design and evaluation toolset to model and evaluate them at multiple resolutions. The universal applicability of the developed methods is showcased by two different architectural fibre structures. The results show how the systematization of methods and toolset allow for increased design flexibility and deeper integration of interdisciplinary collaborators. They constitute an important step towards a consolidated co-design methodology and demonstrate the potential to simultaneously co-evolve design and evaluation methods.}

In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis. Implications for using AI to ease the challenges of multimodal analysis of video data are discussed.}

The two problems that characterize the modern psychology of thinking are mental representation and mental computation. Throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. Thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discovery—how the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. There have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. This chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. Because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. Earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure.}

The third step applies the four new factors to the tectonic processes of five digital projects by well-known architects who have actual building experience in both predigital and digital works. Some phenomena of digital tectonics have emerged to reveal the dynamic factors of motion, information, generation and fabrication.

The findings revealed that students had opportunities for creative involvement in both independent and collaborative settings. While the teacher's general instructional practices supported creative thinking, some challenges became evident. In particular, the teacher's limited understanding of how to foster creativity in mathematics posed obstacles to students' creative engagement. These findings highlight the need for professional development focused on mathematics-specific instructional strategies that help teachers better support students' creative thinking.}

The effectiveness of the synthetic data in training object detection models was thoroughly validated. For the construction worker detection task, a YOLOv7 model trained with synthetic data nearly matched the performance of a model trained with real data: it achieved 71% AP@0.5–0.95 compared to 75% for the real data-trained model. Moreover, the model trained with synthetic data surpassed its real data counterpart in scenarios requiring stricter IoU thresholds, particularly above 85%. Acquiring a sufficient quantity and diverse range of imagery data has been a primary challenge in construction studies that focus on automation and digitization through deep neural networks. BlendCon can significantly contribute to addressing this data scarcity challenge.}

Patent boxes without such a requirement increase patent output in other countries. Patent boxes with such a requirement reduce patent output abroad but only when relocation costs for R&D activity are small.}

abstract = {Data-driven urbanism is often entangled with the smart city and practiced in a way that prioritizes control over physical objects and downplays the human and political aspects of data. We label this approach ‘hard city sensing’ (HCS) and we argue that the rise of the ‘digital city’ offers the empirical foundation for more humanistic approaches. Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning.}

Challenges that currently exist between computational biology and biological computation were outlined and further discussed for a solution to fill the persistent “wet dry” research gap for a better future. Emerging proper techniques for combining data from several modalities is the foremost challenge in handling single-cell multimodal data. This process has been referred to as “data integration” It includes various strategies, from batch-correcting individual omics datasets to correlating chromatin accessibility to development in virtually all genetic mutations with transcription. In this chapter, we offer solutions for how researchers can overcome challenges to inspire the creation of various computer science algorithms and approaches, as well as how computational methods and mathematical modeling have aided in the comprehension of different biological domains, including computational and stem cell biology. A few current references and examples have been incorporated to explain the emerging concepts in computational biology and address existing problems. They are discussed here with their future aspects, hoping to encourage younger researchers to work in this fascinating field and deal with the challenges mentioned before with a modern approach.}

This study addresses these issues through a qualitative analysis of 65 depth interviews with senior editors of business transfer journals, marketing managers, and academic researchers. The authors carve out distinct, multidimensional properties that determine managerial relevance. From specific configurations of these properties, four archetypical relevance types emerge: (1) problem-solving, (2) explicating, (3) consolidating, and (4) forward-thinking relevance. Finally, the authors develop a unifying framework and identify success factors for generating highly relevant research.

On these grounds, the glitch is reframed as an event capable of revealing the potential of the digital in processes of computational making. Ideas concerning the incomputable and non-human intelligence of the algorithm underpin this argument.

Therefore, in this paper, we establish a framework for IRS-assisted MEC computational offloading to solve this problem and take fairness optimization as a key point involving communication and computing resources. Minimize user consumption by optimizing bandwidth allocation, task offloading ratio, edge computing resources, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Firstly, we decompose the problem into three aspects, such as bandwidth allocation, computing resource allocation, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimum solution and its convergence is proved. Secondly, since the optimization problem on transmission power and IRS phase shifts is non-convex, we propose Riemann gradient descent (R-SGD) algorithm to solve it. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms and achieves a superiority in the framework.}

This chapter is an attempt to clear the names of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational cognitive science. These two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. Sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. The best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. Artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. The former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. AI is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. AI ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving Fermat's last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. Historically, AI is associated with computer science, but the compleat AI researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline.}

abstract = {Digital technologies are changing how and where we live, work and socialize. Rural areas are distinctive spaces and places but in the current debates of new digital phenomena, digital spaces and practices risk not being contextualized with sensitivities to rural geographies. This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.}

abstract = {This paper considers the social representation of an incinerator plant operating for more than 30 years in a medium-sized city in Italy. A survey was carried out with a representative sample of an Italian town, a community that was not generally hostile to it. On the basis of self-efficacy and trust in institutions, and by applying cluster analyses, we obtain evidence for four distinct groups labelled as Fatalists, Collaboratives, Activists, and Delegants. The four groups express systematic variations in social representation. We discuss the theoretical and practical impacts of these results.}

abstract = {At Australian Catholic University and Monash University, preservice mathematics teachers are required to conduct and analyse one-to-one mathematics assessment interviews with primary-aged children. The assessment tool is drawn from the Early Numeracy Research Project, where it was used with over 11,000 children in Victorian schools. The interview assesses content from Number, Measurement and Geometry, in an interactive, hands-on format, with children's responses and strategies determining the path through the interview protocol. Follow-up discussion in class enabled preservice teachers to explore appropriate pedagogies that build upon what had been learned from the interviews. The research described in this chapter sought to investigate the effectiveness of this process. Interviews and written questionnaires were the data sources. Analysis of the data suggested that teachers were more aware of the kinds of strategies that children use including their variety and relative level of sophistication, and that the interview and subsequent discussion stimulated preservice teachers to reflect upon appropriate classroom experiences for young mathematics learners.}

abstract = {While games of chance have been played for thousands of years, and while experienced players often had good intuitive ideas of the relative frequencies of various outcomes, the concept of probability as referring to the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes of a ‘fair’ gambling device emerged only 500 or so years ago in Western societies. That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life—as for example in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient—more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.}
