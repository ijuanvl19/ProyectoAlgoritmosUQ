abstract = {Lateral motion of material relative to the regional thermal and kinematic frameworks is important in the interpretation of thermochronology in convergent orogens. Although cooling ages in denuded settings are commonly linked to exhumation, such data are not related to instantaneous behavior but rather to an integration of the exhumation rates experienced between the thermochronological ‘closure’ at depth and subsequent exposure at the surface. The short spatial wavelength variation of thermal structure and denudation rate typical of orogenic regions thus renders thermochronometers sensitive to lateral motion during exhumation. The significance of this lateral motion varies in proportion with closure temperature, which controls the depth at which isotopic closure occurs, and hence, the range of time and length scales over which such data integrate sample histories. Different chronometers thus vary in the fundamental aspects of the orogenic character to which they are sensitive. Isotopic systems with high closure temperature are more sensitive to exhumation paths and the variation in denudation and thermal structure across a region, while those of lower closure temperature constrain shorter-term behaviour and more local conditions. Discounting lateral motion through an orogenic region and interpreting cooling ages purely in terms of vertical exhumation can produce ambiguous results because variation in the cooling rate can result from either change in kinematics over time or the translation of samples through spatially varying conditions. Resolving this ambiguity requires explicit consideration of the physical and thermal framework experienced by samples during their exhumation. This can be best achieved through numerical simulations coupling kinematic deformation to thermal evolution. Such an approach allows the thermochronological implications of different kinematic scenarios to be tested, and thus provides an important means of assessing the contribution of lateral motion to orogenic evolution.}

Unlike protein-coding genes, which can be detected as open reading frames with distinctive statistical biases, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene sequences have no obvious inherent statistical biases [3]. Thus, genome sequence analyses reveal novel protein-coding genes, but any novel ncRNA genes remain invisible. Here, we describe a computational comparative genomic screen for ncRNA genes. The key idea is to distinguish conserved RNA secondary structures from a background of other conserved sequences using probabilistic models of expected mutational patterns in pairwise sequence alignments. We report the first whole-genome screen for ncRNA genes done with this method, in which we applied it to the “intergenic” spacers of Escherichia coli using comparative sequence data from four related bacteria. Starting from >23,000 conserved interspecies pairwise alignments, the screen predicted 275 candidate structural RNA loci. A sample of 49 candidate loci was assayed experimentally. At least 11 loci expressed small, apparently noncoding RNA transcripts of unknown function. Our computational approach may be used to discover structural ncRNA genes in any genome for which appropriate comparative genome sequence data are available.}

In the present paper, two studies are reported with French adults to examine the degree to which the ability to identify emotion is related to creative performance. This component of ability EI was hypothesized to be positively associated with a divergent thinking task involving emotional information. Contrary to our expectations, the first study (n=95) indicated that ability to identify emotions in faces and images was negatively related to idea generation ability. The second study (n=100) including a measure of alexithymia confirmed this relation. Moreover, evaluating emotional creativity, we observed a significant negative link between the ability to identify emotions and the tendency to experience emotions differently from those of others. We discuss these results suggesting an opposition between consensual/convergent thinking concerning emotions (ability EI) and divergent thinking.}

In such contexts, the reliability of user texts is often compromised by behavioural and emotional dimensions. To this end, several attempts have been made in the state of the art, to introduce psychological approaches in such systems, including computational psycholinguistics, personality traits and cognitive psychology methods. In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a psychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian discourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive) characteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their reliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods are systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic framework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it addresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and expression which usually escape methods functioning at “higher”, conscious layers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of psychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse applications. To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake news detection; we first demonstrate certain limitations of the well-known Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type method, and then propose and evaluate our new method of analysing user texts and detecting fake news based on the Lacanian discourses psychoanalytic approach.}

The introduction of the base isolation system has led to a new concept in the construction panorama in terms of human life safety, a new way of thinking on new constructions, improvement and retrofitting on existent structures. Therefore, rubber and friction isolators have been deeply investigated to hence performances and predict dynamic behaviour during an earthquake. While the response of the former is characterised by the composition of the elastomeric compound, the latter features special materials able to dissipate energy by moving on smooth surfaces. This paper focuses on friction pendulum devices and addresses its attention on the behaviour of sliding materials. It is well-known that stick-slip phenomenon occurs when friction excitation is present and, in the anti-seismic field is important to reduce it and have a well-representative mathematical law able to describe it. Therefore, Hirun International after performing several treatments of the sliding materials has set up a special processing to guarantee a stable response of the HI-M material used on pendulum devices. The paper, after a brief presentation of the special sliding material, shows a comparison between the material with and without the treatment in terms of the force-displacement law. The paper also analyses in detail the cinematic behaviour of the sliding pendulum with one or two main sliding surfaces, with and without central articulation and determines the stress distribution in the sliding surfaces for the different cases.}

Knowledge complexity poses a problem to the modeller of representation and, in turn, of reasoning. We seek to overcome this problem by using our ‘privileged’ sense of vision. This means that we render dynamic, multi-modal phenomena as graphic depictions, be they technical visualizations, thought experiments, logic constructions or network graphs. The ‘graphic act’ has been described a being a fundamental activity in human perception, and both scientists and artists have undertaken advanced analyses of the human perception of nature based on visual experiments. Analysis based on reasoning is similarly a graphic act, in the sense that it seeks out patterns of connectivity among socio-spatial agents and entities. Reasoning also depends upon symbolism, which serves to overcome the problem of infinity in nature (a matter that lies at the heart of machine computation). Hence, this chapter introduces some elements in logical reasoning, set theory and computation, and outlines the particular importance of working with symbols. It also provides an introduction to data modelling with graphs, including current advances in graph databases. It provides some ‘tools for thinking’ about knowledge complexity and suggests the potential power in adapting these technologies to organize knowledge of dynamic, complex domains. It also introduces some standard methods for spatial data modelling, including powerful surface network models, which borrow from physical landscape analysis, to support reasoning about knowledge-driven domains.}

Although Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are the most widely used method for drone localization, they are not always reliable and accurate in some scenarios. A recent study explores the visual-based positioning method, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to match geometric features for drone positioning. The authors use an orthophotomap obtained from an actual drone to evaluate their algorithm. This can reduce the gap between research and practical operation. However, the approach overlooks the impact of lighting variations on positioning performance, i.e., brightness and color temperature. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CNN architecture to handle lighting variations. Our method improves reliability, accuracy, and computational complexity under varying lighting conditions by incorporating several critical components into the network. Remarkably, our architecture has only 51.35% trainable parameters and 83.97% floating point operations (FLOPs) of the existing one. Still, we can exceed it by 3.73% while not considering light variations and average 2.36% while considering light variations. The experimental results, also derived from an orthophotomap obtained via an actual drone, demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the challenges induced by lighting changes, ensuring reliable and accurate drone localization.}

The predicament of moral judgments was analyzed and an optimization plan to improve the ethical intention of accountants was proposed. Support Vector Machine classification technology in data mining was studied to explore how to conduct effective and reliable evaluation, so as to provide a scientific basis for decision-making in improving accounting management.

This paper interprets, represents, and implements sequential three-way granular computing by a framework of temporal-spatial multi-granularity learning, which is described with the temporality of data and the spatiality of parameters. In real-world decision-making, such a sequential approach is useful to make faster decisions for some objects with the lower cost of decision process and the acceptable accuracy when information is insufficient or unavailable. However, the cost of time-consuming computation for hierarchical multilevel granularity is our concern. To address this issue, we utilize a local strategy to accelerate a sequence of neighborhood-based granulation induced by Gaussian kernel function. Subsequently, local three-way decision rules are investigated based on the Bayesian minimum risk criterion. Moreover, by the construction of a novel local trisection model, we propose a local sequential approach of three-way granular computing under a temporal-spatial multilevel granular structure. Finally, a series of comparative experiments between global and local perspectives is carried out to verify the effectiveness of our proposed models.}

This kind of syntactic processing in both domains was found to rely on a shared network in the left hemisphere centered on the inferior part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), including pars opercularis and pars triangularis, and on dorsal and ventral long association tracts connecting this brain area with temporo-parietal regions. Language processing utilized some adjacent left hemispheric IFG and middle temporal regions more than music processing, and music processing also involved right hemisphere regions not activated in language processing. Our data indicate that a dual-stream system with dorsal and ventral long association tracts centered on a functionally and structurally highly differentiated left IFG is pivotal for domain–general syntactic competence over a broad range of elements including words and chords.}

Kinetic and thermodynamic data were fed to the Enzyme Cost Minimization algorithm to check for respective inconsistencies and calculate pathway-specific activities. The specific activities of the reductive glycine pathway, the CETCH cycle, and the new reductive citramalyl-CoA cycle were predicted to match the best natural cycles with superior product-substrate yield. However, the CBB cycle performed better in terms of activity compared to the alternative pathways than previously thought. We make an argument that stoichiometric yield is likely not the most important design criterion of the CBB cycle. Still, alternative carbon fixation pathways were paretooptimal for specific activity and product-substrate yield in simulations with C1 substrates and CO2/H2 and therefore hold great potential for future applications in Industrial Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology.}

abstract = {Background
Persecutory delusions are among the most common delusions in schizophrenia and represent the extreme end of the paranoia continuum. Paranoia is accompanied by significant worry and distress. Identifying cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia is critical for advancing treatment. We hypothesized that aberrant belief updating, which is related to paranoia in human and animal models, would also contribute to persecutory beliefs in individuals with schizophrenia.
Methods
Belief updating was assessed in 42 participants with schizophrenia and 44 healthy control participants using a 3-option probabilistic reversal learning task. Hierarchical Gaussian Filter was used to estimate computational parameters of belief updating. Paranoia was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale. Unusual thought content was measured with the Psychosis Symptom Rating Scale and the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Worry was measured using the Dunn Worry Questionnaire.
Results
Paranoia was significantly associated with elevated win-switch rate and prior beliefs about volatility both in schizophrenia and across the whole sample. These relationships were specific to paranoia and did not extend to unusual thought content or measures of anxiety. We observed a significant indirect effect of paranoia on the relationship between prior beliefs about volatility and worry.
Conclusions
This work provides evidence that relationships between belief updating parameters and paranoia extend to schizophrenia, may be specific to persecutory beliefs, and contribute to theoretical models implicating worry in the maintenance of persecutory delusions.}

Multi-agent system architecture offers a promising framework for dynamically managing cooperative agents in a distributed environment while the tree structure based generic algorithm provides a foundation for supporting evolutionary and innovative design abilities. Design is a complex knowledge discovery process. Creative design is a human trait that is not easily converted into a computational tool. Rather than to implement the innovative design by computers, this environment is used to stimulate the imagination of designers and extend their thinking space. It wants to explore a feasible and useful evolutionary approach in a distributed environment that will give the designers concrete help for the creative designs. This approach is illustrated by a mobile phone design example, which used binary algebraic expression tree to form sketch shapes and a feature based product tree to produce component combination choices. Because evolution is guided by human selectors, the evolutionary algorithm is not complex. It shows that approach is able to generate some creative solutions, demonstrating the power of explorative evolution.}

An analytical solution is found to the resulting ODE for a specific choice of one of the hardening model’s parameters. That solution is used to prove that if the prescribed density rise is allowed to be infinitely thin, i.e., like a shock in the mathematical sense, the resulting deviatoric stress is still bounded. In other words, the singularity is integrable; integration of the radial return ODE regularizes the infinite strain rate and resulting yield stress in the presence of an ideal shock singularity. The analytical tools developed for this line of thinking are applied to study the variation of deviatoric stress through a nearly shock-like density rise using different density rise profiles, revealing the impact of the shape choice. The tools are also used to compute what rise times are needed to converge upon the correct value of deviatoric stress through a shock; the results indicate that most contemporary hydrocodes cannot be expected to achieve those rise times. A demonstration of connecting the analytical tools to a hydrocode, using surrogate numerical shock shapes, is provided thereby opening the door for using such surrogates to perform sub-grid computations of converged shock behavior for strain-rate hardening materials.}

However, relevant studies tend to overlook the temporal dimension of social media, potentially systematic patterning of linguistic behavior across time, and the attendant implications of such a temporal perspective on identity. Combining an automated lexical tool (LIWC) and the Box–Jenkins method of statistical time series analysis, this paper shows how the ‘modelability’ of linguistic choices across time can be interpreted as signatures of identity construction and complement existing frameworks for identity analysis. Two levels of modelability are discussed—the availability of a well-fitting time series model as evidence of temporal patterning, and specific parameters of that model interpreted in context. These are demonstrated with a case study of the construction of ‘amateur expertise’ over 109 consecutive makeup tutorial videos on the popular YouTube channel ‘Nikkiestutorials’. Results show that the linguistic display of ‘analytical thinking’ reflects a strategy of ‘short term momentum’, the display of ‘clout’ and ‘authenticity’ a strategy of ‘short term restoration’, while the display of ‘emotional tone’ fluctuates randomly across time. The approach is further discussed in terms of its general principles and potential applications in other contexts of identity and related research.}

abstract = {As humans, we rely on intuitive reasoning for most of our decisions. However, when there is a novel or atypical decision to be made, we must rely on a slower and more deliberative thought process—analytical reasoning. As we gain experience with these novel or atypical decisions, our reasoning shifts from analytical to intuitive, which parallels a reduction in the need for cognitive control. Here, we sought to confirm this claim by employing electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of cognitive control as participants performed a simple perceptual decision-making task. Specifically, we had participants categorize “blobs” into families based on their visual attributes so we could examine how their reasoning changed with learning. In a key manipulation, halfway through the experiment we introduced novel blob families to categorize, thus temporarily increasing the need for analytical reasoning (i.e., cognitive control). Congruent with past research, we focused our EEG analyses on frontal theta activity as it has been linked to cognitive control and analytical thinking. As hypothesized, we found a transition from analytical to intuitive decision-making systems with learning as indexed by a decrease in frontal theta power. Further, when the novel blobs were introduced at the midpoint of the experiment, we found that decisions about these stimuli recruited analytical reasoning as indicated by increased theta power in comparison to decisions about well-practiced stimuli. We propose our findings to reflect prediction errors to decision demands—a monitoring process that determines whether our expectations of demands are met. Shifting from analytical to intuitive reasoning thus reflects the stabilization of our expectations of decision demands, which can be violated with unexpected demands when encountering novel stimuli.}

The recently proposed computation-flexible BERT models facilitate their deployment in varied computational environments. Training such flexible BERT models involves jointly optimizing multiple BERT subnets, which will unavoidably interfere with one another. Besides, the performance of large subnets is limited by the performance gap between the smallest subnet and the supernet, despite efforts to enhance the smaller subnets. In this regard, we propose layer-wise Neural grafting to boost BERT subnets, especially the larger ones. The proposed method improves the average performance of the subnets on six GLUE tasks and boosts the supernets on all GLUE tasks and the SQuAD data set. Based on the boosted subnets, we further build an inference framework enabling practical width- and depth-dynamic inference regarding different inputs by combining width-dynamic gating modules and early exit off-ramps in the depth dimension. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a better dynamic inference range than other methods in terms of trading off performance and computational complexity on four GLUE tasks and SQuAD. In particular, our best-tradeoff inference result outperforms other fixed-size models with similar amount of computations. Compared to BERT-Base, the proposed inference framework yields a 1.3-point improvement in the average GLUE score and a 2.2-point increase in the F1 score on SQuAD, while reducing computations by around 45%.}

In an array of PV modules it is possible to observe multiple peaks in the power versus voltage (P-V) curve due to the current versus voltage (I–V) PV cell mismatch caused by differences in the received irradiance, such as occurs during partial shading. In these circumstances, the ability of the MPPT devices to track the global MPP of the PV array directly influences the system efficiency. In the literature, various MPPT techniques have been proposed. Among them, computational intelligence (CI) algorithm based MPPT methods have demonstrated the ability to find the global MPP. This paper presents a detailed and specific review of CI- based MPPT techniques. Each method type is classified into one of several subcategories according to its application strategy. The various ways of applying CI into MPPTs are analyzed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and compared. The purpose of this study is to provide a compendium on CI-based MPPT techniques for users to understand and select an appropriate method based on application requirements and system constraints.}

Classical models of memory in psychology and neuroscience rely on similarity-based retrieval of stored patterns, where similarity is a function of retrieval cues and the stored patterns. Although parsimonious, these models do not allow distinct representations for storage and retrieval, despite their distinct computational demands. Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine-learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.}

Most complex diseases arise on a background of genetics, lifestyle and environment factors, and manifest themselves as a spectrum of symptoms. To fathom intricate biological processes and their changes from healthy to disease states, we need to systematically integrate and analyze multi-omics datasets, ontologies, and diverse annotations. Without proper management of such complex biological and clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms alone cannot be effectively trained, validated, and successfully applied to provide trustworthy and patient-centric diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Precision medicine requires to use multi-omics approaches effectively, and offers many opportunities for using AI, “big data” analytics, and integrative computational biology workflows. Advances in optical and biochemical assay technologies including sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging modalities have transformed research by empowering us to simultaneously view all genes expressed, identify proteome-wide changes, and assess interacting partners of each individual protein within a dynamically changing biological system, at an individual cell level. While such views are already having an impact on our understanding of healthy and disease conditions, it remains challenging to extract useful information comprehensively and systematically from individual studies, ensure that signal is separated from noise, develop models, and provide hypotheses for further research. Data remain incomplete and are often poorly connected using fragmented biological networks. In addition, statistical and machine learning models are developed at a cohort level and often not validated at the individual patient level. Combining integrative computational biology and AI has the potential to improve understanding and treatment of diseases by identifying biomarkers and building explainable models characterizing individual patients. From systematic data analysis to more specific diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, drug mechanism of action, and patient selection, such analyses influence multiple steps from prevention to disease characterization, and from prognosis to drug discovery. Data mining, machine learning, graph theory and advanced visualization may help identify diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and create causal models of disease. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments leads to faster, more biologically and clinically relevant discoveries. However, computational analysis results and models are going to be only as accurate and useful as correct and comprehensive are the networks, ontologies and datasets used to build them. High quality, curated data portals provide the necessary foundation for translational research. They help to identify better biomarkers, new drugs, precision treatments, and should lead to improved patient outcomes and their quality of life. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments, efficiently and effectively leads to more useful findings faster.}

This chapter discusses the process of thinking and knowing. Forming concepts, propositions, problems, and directions are examples of thinking. Thinking can be visual, verbal, or abstract. It can be chaotic or orderly, creative, or routine. Thinking of any kind is an activity of some plastic neural systems. Of all mental activities, thinking is probably the one most affected by chemical changes and changes in basic properties of neurons. For example, humans unable to oxidize the amino acid phenylalanine cannot think, thyroid hypofunction produces cretinism, and normal subjects cannot think straight when in states of extreme stress, which are often states of hormonal imbalance, or when under the action of psychotropic drugs. The chapter also discusses the concept of cognition. All cognition is learned but not every learned item is of a cognitive nature. All cognition is cognition of some object, concrete or conceptual, and it consists in some information about its object—complete or partial, true or false. Cognition can be behavioral, perceptual, or conceptual.}

Passive methods and active learning methodologies such as Guided Reciprocal Peer Questioning (GRPQ), Think-Pair-Share (TPS), and Problem Based Learning (PBL) are compared. Each methodology was applied to three groups of students of Industrial Engineering of a Brazilian University, totaling 138 students. As a result, PBL obtained the best assessment in the three groups, followed by GRPQ. The proposed framework validates the assessment of learning methodologies, providing a structure and guideline for its replication in other educational institutions.}

For the first time, we show here how these steps can be addressed simultaneously using the null-collision concept. This opens the door to the design of Monte Carlo codes directly estimating radiative transfer observables from spectroscopic databases. The intermediate step of producing accurate high-resolution absorption spectra is no longer required. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed and applied to six one-dimensional test cases. It allows the computation of spectrally integrated intensities (over 25cm−1 bands or the full IR range) in a few seconds, regardless of the retained database and line model. But free parameters need to be selected and they impact the convergence. A first possible selection is provided in full detail. We observe that this selection is highly satisfactory for quite distinct atmospheric and combustion configurations, but a more systematic exploration is still in progress.}

The goal of the GDL initiative is to leverage students' interests in games and design to foster their problem-solving and critical reasoning skills. The present study examines the effectiveness of an after-school version of the GDL program using a quasi-experimental design. Students enrolled in the GDL program were guided in the process of designing games aimed at solving problems. Compared to students in a control group who did not attend the program (n = 24), the children who attended the GDL program (n = 20) showed a significant increase in their problem-solving skills. The results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that participation in the GDL program leads to measurable cognitive changes in children's problem-solving skills. This study bears important implications for educators and theory.}

abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often challenging to apply in real-world settings since evolutionary computations involve a large number of evaluations of a typically expensive fitness function. For example, an evaluation could involve training a new machine learning model. An approximation (also known as meta-model or a surrogate) of the true function can be used in such applications to alleviate the computation cost. In this paper, we propose a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary approach to address the computational issues arising from using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection in a wrapper setting for large datasets. We define “Approximation Usefulness” to capture the necessary conditions to ensure correctness of the EA computations when an approximation is used. Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. A GitHub repository with the complete implementation is available.22https://github.com/Ghaith81/Fast-Genetic-Algorithm-For-Feature-Selection.}

This impact is likely to accelerate and become even more significant as the computational potential of generative AI grows through training on more diverse and more extensive language models and data sets. Emerging research in this new field suggests that previous models of understanding the interactions between machine and human may no longer be sufficient in a world of generative AI. The significant question is how emerging generative AI technologies will relate to and be a part of human creativity and creative outputs. In this article, we adopt a posthuman stance and conceive of creative output involving generative AI and humans in terms of a yet-to-be-fully-realised and emergent relationship that will likely become more integrated and complex. To investigate and experiment with this relational notion, each of us (as part of an autoethnographic approach) developed a creative output using ChatGPT: a poem and a multimodal narrative. We then employed the idea of alterity relations from the American philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, to conceive of the possibilities and limitations in working relationally and productively with generative AI. As two academics working in teacher education, we applied our learning from this exploration to possibilities in educational contexts. In this article, we offer several important implications and provocations for practitioners, researchers, educators and policymakers, not only in terms of practical concerns but also for rethinking the nature of the creative output.}

We employ state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms such as Spectrasafe Algorithm, Facile Hash Algorithm and Dynamic k-anonymity (DKA Algorithm) to protect healthcare data at rest and during transit. Conducting a series of performance comparisons, using this high-quality data meticulously prepared from Kaggle to compare it with existing methods SMPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation), MSHC (Multi Server Homomorphic Encryption), AHC-ASS (Attribute-Hiding Cryptography with Attribute-Based Secret Sharing), MP-FHE（Multiparty Fully Homomorphic Encryption). Our encryption and decryption runtime are intensive computationally, with an average runtime of 99 ms and 108 ms, respectively. In terms of memory size our approach is 25 % smaller than existing state-of-the-art methods which indicates that it has a higher efficiency. Our method attains a detection accuracy of 95 %, which is also significant than results of previous methods. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to scale across a wide variety of healthcare datasets and updated requirements seen in modern healthcare systems.

One of the central challenges of computer science is to get a computer to solve a problem without programming it explicitly. The challenge is to create an automatic system whose input is a high-level statement of a problem's requirements and whose output is a satisfactory solution to the given problem. This challenge is the common goal of such fields of research as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Paraphrasing Arthur Samuel, this challenge addresses the question: How can computers are made to do what needs to be done, without being told exactly how to do it? As Samuel further explained: “The aim is to get machines to exhibit behavior, which if done by humans, would be assumed to involve the use of intelligence.” This chapter provides an affirmative answer to the following two questions: Starting only with a high-level statement of the problem's requirements, can computers automatically discover the solution to nontrivial problems? And, can automatically created solutions be competitive with the products of human creativity and inventiveness? In answering these questions, this chapter focuses on a biologically inspired domain-independent problem-solving technique of evolutionary computation, called genetic programming. For each problem, genetic programming automatically creates entities that improve on previously patented inventions, or duplicate the functionality of previously patented inventions or duplicate the functionality of previously patented inventions. The chapter also discusses the importance of illogic in achieving creativity and inventiveness.}

The understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders present unique challenges due to these conditions' multifaceted nature, comprising dynamic interactions between biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors. Traditional reductionistic approaches often simplify these conditions into linear cause-and-effect relationships, overlooking the complexity and interconnectedness inherent in psychiatric disorders. Advances in complex systems approaches provide a comprehensive framework to capture and quantify the non-linear and emergent properties of psychiatric disorders. This Personal View emphasises the importance of identifying rules for generative models that govern brain and behaviour over time, which might contribute to personalised assessments and interventions for psychiatric disorders. For instance, mood fluctuations in bipolar disorder can be understood through dynamical systems modelling, which identifies modifiable parameters, such as circadian disruption, that can be addressed through targeted therapies such as light therapy. Similarly, recognition of depression as an emergent property arising from complex interactions highlights the need for integrated treatment strategies that enhance adaptive reactions in the individual. A framework for quantifying multilevel interactions and network dynamics can help researchers and clinicians to understand the interplay between neural circuits, behaviours, and social contexts. Probabilistic models and self-organisation concepts contribute to building concrete dynamical systems models of mental disorders, facilitating early identification of risk states and promoting resilience through adaptive interventions delivered with optimal timing. Embracing these complex systems approaches in psychiatry could capture the true nature of psychiatric disorders as properties of a dynamic complex system and not the manifestation of any lesion or insult. This line of thinking might improve diagnosis and treatment, offering new hope for individuals affected by psychiatric conditions and paving the way for more effective, personalised mental health care.}

We propose the $-calculus as a more complete model for problem solving to provide a support to handle intractability and undecidability. It goes beyond the Turing Machine model. We define the semantics of the $-calculus using a novel optimization method (the kΩ-optimization), which approximates a nonexisting universal search algorithm and allows the simulation of many other search methods. In particular, the notion of total optimality has been utilized to provide an automatic way to deal with intractability of problem solving by optimizing together the quality of solutions and search costs. The sufficient conditions needed for completeness, optimality and total optimality of problem solving search are defined. A very flexible classification scheme of problem solving methods into easy, hard and solvable in the limit classes has been proposed. In particular, the third class deals with non-recursive solutions of undecidable problems. The approach is illustrated by solutions of some intractable and undecidable problems. We also briefly overview two possible implementations of the $-calculus.}

abstract = {In this new era, technological advancement toward the mission of a better tomorrow is reaching its limit because the exploration of the advanced possibilities of Artificial Intelligence is bounded with certain limitations. The application of analyzing various features of biosignal processing is key in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Biosignals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electrooculography (EOG), Galvanic Skin Response(GSR), and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is already giving deep insight into the human body toward the identification of diverse nature and disorders. In recent years, the research toward analyzing biosignal gained interest among many researchers. The primary limitation for the algorithms to analyze these signals for more possibilities of insight is its uncertainty. Even though the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence have the capabilities to unravel the mysteries, it is bounded with specific difficulties. The machine learning algorithms designed to manage uncertain data but lacks accuracy due to many factors. Also, complete supervision is needed in a training process that involves the extraction and selection of adequate features for the training. The deep learning method (a subset of machine learning) comes into the picture due to one of these facts. This, indeed, as a supervised learning method, needs a massive volume of data to train to reach the accuracy goal. The deep learning algorithm plays a significant role in today's Artificial Intelligence–based applications. However, this platform needs many requirements, such as (a) high computational power like graphical processing units (GPU); (b) similar to machine learning methods, a massive labeled dataset for supervised learning; (c) adequate parameter selection to avoid overfitting or underfitting. To overcome the problems highlighted, the strategy of adopting the behaviors of unsupervised learning (performed by the clustering algorithm) in the deep learning methodology is needed. To achieve the goal, two-phase operations were processed, such as (1) transformation of the data elements into a latent feature space (Z) is processed through a nonlinear mapping of deep learning networks; (2) clustering the latent feature space to k-clusters, and simultaneously, the clustering loss is fed to the deep learning network for the next iteration of operation concerning the objective function convergence analyzed by the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Various strategies of enhancing the nature of deep learning methods and clustering methodologies for an unsupervised learning process are addressed in this chapter.}

In this paper we reflect on two decades of experience with the application of language-based assessment to patients' mental state and cognitive function by addressing the questions of what we are measuring, how it should be measured and why we are measuring the phenomena. We address the questions by advocating for a principled framework for aligning computational models to the constructs being assessed and the tasks being used, as well as defining how those constructs relate to patient clinical states. We further examine the assumptions that go into the computational models and the effects that model design decisions may have on the accuracy, bias and generalizability of models for assessing clinical states. Finally, we describe how this principled approach can further the goal of transitioning language-based computational assessments to part of clinical practice while gaining the trust of critical stakeholders.}

Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems.

Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.}

Laplacian centrality (LC) measures nodal influence by computing nodes' degree, making it extremely low complexity. However, there is still significant room for improvement. Consequently, we propose the improved Laplacian centrality (ILC) to identify influential nodes based on the concept of self-consistent. Identifying results on 9 real networks prove that ILC is superior to LC and other 6 classical measures in terms of ranking accuracy, top-k nodes identification and discrimination capability. Moreover, the computational complexity of ILC has not significantly increased compared to LC, and remains the linear order of magnitude O(m). Additionally, ILC has excellent robustness and universality such that there is no need to adjust parameters according to different network structures.}

The scope of this study is twofold: to design a comprehensive benchmark for verbal creativity assessment of LLMs and then to run the same creativity tests on different LLMs as well as on humans, for a direct comparison. We aimed to raise the replicability and extensibility of the creativity assessment of LLMs. Hence, we adapted different types of creativity tests and different criteria from psychology to fit the LLMs profile. We also employed computer-assisted evaluation methods, by using the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI), as we wanted to focus exclusively on automated approaches to assessing creativity. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the data set of both human and machine-generated answers and interpreted the results. Finally, we provide both the original verbal creativity test that we have designed, and the curated data comprising all the collected answers, from the LLMs and from the humans that participated in this research.}

We also measured depressive symptoms and rumination. Results show that in individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms MW during SART predicts higher accessibility of negative thoughts after the task, rather than negative thinking during the task.

One of the major categories of SSL methods, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL) learns labels of unlabeled data on an adjacency graph, where neighborhood sparse graph is often used to reduce computational complexity. However, the neighborhood size is difficult to set. Instead of assigning a concrete value of neighborhood size, we propose a new label propagation algorithm called multi granularity based label propagation (MGLP) and developed from the view of granular computing. In MGLP, labels of unlabeled data are learned by two classic label propagation processes with diverse neighborhood size k, where granular computing delivers a guiding strategy to leverage multiple level neighborhood information granules, and three-way decision acts as an active learning strategy to select the unlabeled data for further annotating. Through the iterative procedures of label propagating, data annotating and data subset updating, the ultimate pseudo label accuracy of unlabeled data may be higher. Theoretically, the accuracy of pseudo labels is enhanced in some scenarios. Experimentally, the results of simulation studies on ten benchmark datasets, show that the proposed method MGLP can rise pseudo labels accuracy by 8.6% than LP (label propagation), 6.5% than LNP (linear neighborhood propagation), 6.4% than LPSN (label propagation through sparse neighborhood), 4.5% than Adaptive-NP (adaptive neighborhood propagation) and 4.6% than CRLP (consensus rate-based label propagation). It also provides a novel way to annotate data.}

abstract = {Two implicit finite element formulations for incompressible flows have been implemented on the Connection Machine supercomputers and successfully applied to a set of time-dependent problems. The stabilized space-time formulation for moving boundaries and interfaces, and a new stabilized velocity-pressure-stress formulation are both described, and significant aspects of the implementation of these methods on massively parallel architectures are discussed. Several numerical results for flow problems involving moving as well as fixed cylinders and airfoils are reported. The parallel implementation, taking full advantage of the computational speed of the new generation of supercomputers, is found to be a significant asset in fluid dynamics research. Its current capability to solve large-scale problems, especially when coupled with the potential for growth enjoyed by massively parallel computers, make the implementation a worthwhile enterprise.}

The internet and the information revolution may finally offer the opportunity to use and develop inductive learning practices and information based social inquiry in ways Pragmatic philosophers envisioned a hundred years ago, while the recent rise of connectionist and cognitive architecture works provides a concrete context for such developments. This confluence of process represents the type of synergy that only history can offer. The information revolution – exemplified by both the rise of connectionism and the internet – is the apotheosis of the Pragmatic revolution – bringing together radical empiricism and democratization of information in community practice. We offer three important realizations in our understanding of how information is organized and thinking progresses made possible by burgeoning virtual communities on the internet – open source thinking, scale-free networks, and interrelationships in the development of blogs to illustrate our thesis.}

abstract = {Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V&V in production and commercial software.}

abstract = {Children’s executive functions (EFs) and family socioeconomic status (SES) play critical roles in the development of mathematical ability in early elementary education. However, the potential interplay between EFs and SES remains underexplored. This study addressed this gap by comprehensively investigating the moderating role of SES in the relationship between EF subcomponents (i.e., interference inhibition, response inhibition, and working memory) and children’s concurrent and future mathematical abilities (i.e., arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills). A total of 172 participants (Mage = 6.78 years; 107 boys) took part in the study at the beginning of first grade in elementary school (T1) and 20 months later (T2). We measured EFs, SES, and mathematical ability at T1 and mathematical ability at T2. Results from hierarchical linear regression models indicated that working memory was positively associated with T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills as well as with T2 arithmetic operations. Furthermore, family SES was positively associated with arithmetic operations at both T1 and T2. Notably, we found a significant interaction effect between interference inhibition and SES on T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills. Specifically, interference inhibition was positively related to T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills for children from low- and middle-SES families, but not for children from high-SES families. Our findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of how cognitive and environmental factors jointly influence mathematical development, underscoring the need for targeted interventions for children from different SES backgrounds to support their mathematical ability development.}

In this approach, culture is conceived of as a system and a process of symbolic mediation, where values, norms, and beliefs manifest in and through customs, rituals, and practices in directing and regulating both intrapersonal and interpersonal psychological functions. To capture the dynamic process in which cognitive development unfolds in cultural context, this approach examines the influence of culture on the developing cognitive skills between groups – group level analysis, between the child and socialization agents – dyadic level analysis, at the level of the child – individual level analysis, and within the child – situation level analysis. The temporal level analysis further situates cognitive development in historical time. By utilizing different analytical and methodological strategies, the multi-level analysis approach provides converging evidence for the development of cognitive skills in cultural context. Important challenges in this approach include the development of a “big picture” to guide the investigation, methodological training for research assistants, and difficulties in collecting, managing, and analyzing diverse datasets. I discuss the conceptual and methodological issues by using our work on the development of episodic thinking as an example.}

The successful detection and override of conflict between heuristic and analytic processes has been a focus of dual processes models, especially in adult samples. These miserly processing tendencies have also been described in developmental samples. The measurement of resistance to miserly information processing has been assessed using several tasks, including ratio bias, belief bias syllogisms, cognitive reflection, and disjunctive thinking tasks. Several of these tasks have been studied in developmental samples, including in the longitudinal study described in this volume. There is evidence to suggest that resistance to miserly information processing is measurable in children and youth. While judgment and decision-making tasks vary in the degree to which override of miserly processing is required, individuals also vary in their ability to resist miserly processing tendencies. Individual differences in resistance to miserly information processing serve as an additional foundation to support rational thinking performance.}

How do we achieve this vision? Thinking differently, in silico methods could be used to provide a detailed assessment of target- and modality-related toxicological risks, coupled with modelling of exposure. In vitro NAMs such as microphysiological systems, microelectrode array and ion channel panels could then be employed to address hypothetical risks. Finally, the safety of first time in human trials could be assessed and assured using circulating nanobots that measure conventional clinical pathology parameters alongside new biomarkers such as circulating tissue DNA.

To guarantee real-time performance, the EKF-SLAM implementation requires a high-performance hardware architecture. In light of this challenge, researchers are thinking about using parallel processing platforms like FPGAs, which can provide the required level of performance and meet strict constraints on physics, computing capacity, and electrical power. This study describes a hardware architecture's implementation design for EKF-SLAM on an FPGA platform. The entire design is built on the Cyclone 2 FPGA, which has a maximum speed of 114 MHz and 18577 LUTs, creating a highly efficient hardware architecture.}

The complexity of structural environment and management makes its operation and maintenance difficult. To solve this problem, a distributed mixed reality (MR) and internet of things (IoT) system is developed through game thinking. Firstly, digital models are created based on design drawings and real-world environments, and then an MR system for the UPN is built by the game engine and the OpenXR platform. Secondly, an IoT cloud platform is built to connect with the MR system based on the API sets and cloud services; the data communication between sensors and MR devices is linked with the Socket method, and the data filtering model is constructed by the Kalman algorithm to realize the information exchange between the field workers and the backend managers. Finally, the National Center for Materials Service Safety at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (NCMS_USTB) is used as the experimental site to test this system, and its underground sewage and rainwater pipeline network are used to simulate the key problems in the operation and maintenance. The effect of the application shows that there is potential technical complementarity between the MR and IoT, and the distributed MR-IoT approach can be used as a new technical reference for the operation and maintenance of the UPN.}

abstract = {Herbert Simon made overlapping substantive contributions to the fields of economics, psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, decision theory, and organization theory. Simon’s work was motivated by the belief that neither the human mind, human thinking and decision making, nor human creativity need be mysterious. It was after he helped create “thinking” machines that Simon came to understand human intuition as subconscious pattern recognition. In doing so he showed that intuition need not be associated with magic and mysticism, and that it is complementary with analytical thinking. This paper will show how the overlaps in his work and especially his work on AI affected his view towards intuition.}

FRAM is the best-known Resilience Engineering method with several examples of its application in healthcare available. However, the guidance on how to apply FRAM leaves gaps, and this can be a potential barrier to its adoption and potentially lead to misuse and disappointing results. The article provides a self-reflective analysis of FRAM use cases to provide further methodological guidance for successful application of FRAM to improve patient safety. Five FRAM use cases in a range of healthcare settings are described in a structured way including critical reflection by the original authors of those studies. Individual reflections are synthesised through group discussion to identify lessons for the operationalisation of FRAM in healthcare. Four themes are developed: (1) core characteristics of a FRAM study, (2) flexibility regarding the underlying epistemological paradigm, (3) diversity with respect to the development of interventions, and (4) model complexity. FRAM is a systems analysis method that offers considerable flexibility to accommodate different epistemological positions, ranging from realism to phenomenology. We refer to these as computational FRAM and reflexive FRAM, respectively. Practitioners need to be clear about their analysis aims and their analysis position. Further guidance is needed to support practitioners to tell a convincing and meaningful “system story” through the lens of FRAM.}

abstract = {Four principal factors contribute to grain-boundary strengthening: (a) the grain boundaries act as barriers to plastic flow; (b) the grain boundaries act as dislocation sources; (c) elastic anisotropy causes additional stresses in grain-boundary surroundings; (d) multislip is activated in the grain-boundary regions, whereas grain interiors are initially dominated by single slip, if properly oriented. As a result, the regions adjoining grain boundaries harden at a rate much higher than grain interiors. A phenomenological constitutive equation predicting the effect of grain size on the yield stress of metals is discussed and extended to the nanocrystalline regime. At large grain sizes, it has the Hall–Petch form, and in the nanocrystalline domain the slope gradually decreases until it asymptotically approaches the flow stress of the grain boundaries. The material is envisaged as a composite, comprised of the grain interior, with flow stress σfG, and grain boundary work-hardened layer, with flow stress σfGB. The predictions of this model are compared with experimental measurements over the mono, micro, and nanocrystalline domains. Computational predictions are made of plastic flow as a function of grain size incorporating differences of dislocation accumulation rate in grain-boundary regions and grain interiors. The material is modeled as a monocrystalline core surrounded by a mantle (grain-boundary region) with a high work hardening rate response. This is the first computational plasticity calculation that accounts for grain size effects in a physically-based manner. A discussion of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocations in the framework of strain-gradient plasticity is introduced to describe these effects. Grain-boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline regime is predicted from calculations using the Raj–Ashby model and incorporated into the computations; it is shown to predispose the material to shear localization.}

But the perceived plausibility of those counterfactual thoughts varies widely. The current article interfaces research in the philosophy and semantics of counterfactual statements with the psychology of mental simulations, and it explores the role of perceived similarity in judgments of counterfactual plausibility. We report results from seven studies (N = 6405) jointly supporting three interconnected claims. First, the perceived plausibility of a counterfactual event is predicted by the perceived similarity between the possible world in which the imagined situation is thought to occur and the actual world. Second, when people attend to differences between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as less similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as less plausible. Lastly, when people attend to what is identical between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as more similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as more plausible. We discuss these results in light of philosophical, semantic, and psychological theories of counterfactual thinking.}

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability in handling reasoning tasks. However, unlike humans who can instinctively adapt their problem-solving strategies to the complexity of task, most LLM-based methods adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. These methods employ consistent models, sample sizes, prompting methods and levels of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. The inflexibility of these methods can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver (AS) framework that dynamically adapts solving strategies to suit various problems, enabling the flexible allocation of test-time computational resources. The framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the reliability of the current solution using answer consistency. If the solution is deemed unreliable, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, various types of adaptation strategies are employed collaboratively. Through such dynamic and multi-faceted adaptations, our framework can help reduce computational consumption and improve performance. Experimental results from complex reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method can significantly reduce API costs (up to 85%) while maintaining original performance. Alternatively, it achieves up to 4.5% higher accuracy compared to the baselines at the same cost. The datasets and code are available at https://github.com/john1226966735/Adaptive-Solver.}

Traditionally, it is believed that neurons encode and communicate information via electrochemical impulses, generating electromagnetic fields detectable by EEG and MEG. Recent discoveries indicate that neurons may also emit biophotons, suggesting an additional communication channel alongside the regular synaptic interactions. This dual signaling system is analyzed for its potential in synchronizing neuronal activity and improving information transfer, with implications for brain-like computing systems. The clinical relevance is explored through the lens of neurodegenerative diseases and intrinsically disordered proteins, where oxidative stress may alter biophoton emission, offering clues for pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic use of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is also examined for its ability to modulate biophoton activity and mitigate oxidative stress, presenting new opportunities for treatment. Here, we invite further exploration into the intricate roles the electromagnetic phenomena play in brain function, potentially leading to breakthroughs in computational neuroscience and medical therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.}

Its major achievements include methodologies and tools to support process modeling, simulation and optimization (MSO). Mature, commercially available technologies have been penetrating all fields of chemical engineering in academia as well as in industrial practice. MSO technologies have become a commodity, they are not a distinguishing feature of the PSE field any more. Consequently, PSE has to reassess and to reposition its future research agenda. Emphasis should be put on model-based applications in all PSE domains including product and process design, control and operations. Furthermore, systems thinking and systems problem solving have to be prioritized rather than the mere application of computational problem solving methods. This essay reflects on the past, present and future of PSE from an academic and industrial point of view. It redefines PSE as an active and future-proof research field which can play an active role in providing enabling technologies for product and process innovations in the chemical industries and beyond.}

abstract = {Neurocognitive research is pertinent to developing mechanistic models of how humans generate creative thoughts. Such models usually overlook the role of the motor cortex in creative thinking. The framework of embodied or grounded cognition suggests that creative thoughts (e.g. using a shoe as a hammer, improvising a piano solo) are partially served by simulations of motor activity associated with tools and their use. The major hypothesis stemming from the embodied or grounded account is that, while the motor system is used to execute actions, simulations within this system also support higher-order cognition, creativity included. That is, the cognitive process of generating creative output, not just executing it, is deeply embedded in motor processes. Here, we highlight a collection of neuroimaging research that implicates the motor system in generating creative thoughts, including some evidence for its functionally necessary role in generating creative output. Specifically, the grounded or embodied framework suggests that generating creative output may, in part, rely on motor simulations of possible actions, and that these simulations may by partially implemented in the motor regions themselves. In such cases, action simulations (i.e. reactivating or re-using the motor system), do not result in overt action but instead are used to support higher-order cognitive goals like generating creative uses or improvising.}

On ‘area’ trials, test width was a random variable, ensuring that neither shape (aspect ratio), width nor height by themselves was a reliable signal. Weber fractions for width and height of both ellipses and rectangles were in the range 5–10%, but for area they were higher (10–20%) than predicted from the combination of noisy width and height decisions. With ellipses, observers were more likely to overestimate width or height when the other dimension differed from the standard in the same direction (e.g. both greater). We conclude that observers have no access to high-precision codes for 2-D area, and that they base their decisions on a variety of heuristics derived from 1-D codes. A second experiment measured acuity for changes in aspect ratio. For ellipses, accuracy for aspect ratio was higher than predicted by the combination of noisy width and height signals; for rectangles it was worse, suggesting that 2-D curvature is a potent cue to shape.}

TMNAS uniquely integrates predefined template-modules into a flexible search space, enabling simultaneous exploration of architectural components and parameters. By incorporating a single-objective genetic algorithm with a computational complexity penalty term, our approach effectively avoids local optima and significantly reduces search resource consumption.

With the proliferation of home working, reliance on electricity for heating and cooling and the increasing needs for electric charging for transportation, there is an urgent need to develop novel ways for efficient management of home energy use. Current efforts focus on HEM technologies at individual household levels, without considering the social or spatial context or their collective community-wide interrelated dependencies. We propose a multifaceted agenda at the intersection of disciplinary domains to tackle this problem by using a multidimensional lens that draws on energy behaviour, architectural research, biomimetics, and computational design, simultaneously. Optimal and effective behavioural patterns can be extracted and abstracted from nature, informing a more collective and interrelated behavioural dependencies approach that considers the complex multidimensional energy use patterns of different housing typologies. This paper discusses the analytical benefits of this new research approach through a study of home energy management behaviour. The approach though could be expanded to consider other similar empirical contexts whereby sustainable multidimensional resource management is sought such as water use, food distribution as well as transport and mobility.}

Students’ expression of visual fluency in the course of making sense of the eigenvalue problem Au=λu associated with a variety of matrices occurred in different, yet not necessarily hierarchical modes of visualizations that differed from matrix to matrix: (i) synthetic/analytic mode manifested in the process of detecting eigenvectors when the sought eigenvector and the matrix-applied product vector were aligned in the same/opposite directions; (ii) analytic arithmetic mode manifested in the case of singular matrices (in the determination of the zero eigenvalue) and invertible matrices with nonreal eigenvalues; (iii) analytic structural mode, though rarely occurred, manifested in making sense of the trajectory (circle, ellipse, line segment) of the matrix-applied product vector and relating trajectory behavior to matrix type. While the connection between the thinking modes (Sierpinska, 2000) and the concreteness–necessity–generalizability triad (Harel, 2000) was not sharp, math majors still frequently implemented the CNG principles, which proved facilitatory tools in the evolution of students’ thinking about the eigenvalue–eigenvector relationships.}

Concerning learning, the function of topologies in heuristic learning is explored, multiple kinds of memory are addressed, such as “enactive”, “semantic”, episodic, and autobiographical, and some of the enabling and constraining developmental consequences of knowing levels are examined. In the section on emotions, basic principles of developmental differentiations of emotions are examined, and the evolution of emotion processes within organizations of microgenesis processes is framed. The discussion of reflective consciousness addresses enablings such as rehearsal and purpose, and extends the evolutionary analysis to the emergence of the possibility of reflection in the brain. Issues concerning experiencing, such as unities and boundaries, are addressed. Reflective experiencing of experiencing is presented as a resolution of a fundamental problem in the literature. Some further literature is addressed, such as higher order theory, Brentano, Searle, and folk psychology.}

abstract = {Creativity is related to a higher flexible semantic memory structure, which could explain greater fluency of ideas. Extensive research has identified a positive connection between creativity and bi-/multilingualism mainly in contexts where two languages or more concur in daily communicative interactions. Yet, creativity has received scant attention in regard to L2 (second or foreign language) acquisition that mainly takes place in classroom situations. The scarce research points to a positive relationship between creativity and L2 fluency – understood as the number of words produced. We apply computational network science analysis and Forward Flow methods to examine lexical organization patterns of a low creativity (LC) and high creativity (HC) group of 12th grade Spanish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The participants completed two fluency tasks, where they generated animal names in their L2, and also L1 – used here as a control measure. EFL proficiency was controlled. Our analyses revealed that the HC individuals were more fluent in L1 and L2, generated more remote responses, and exhibited a more flexible and efficiently structured semantic memory in both languages, with a greater effect of creativity in L2. Contrary to previous research, the L2 semantic memory network exhibited a less random organization. Differences in the L2 learning conditions are adduced as likely causes of this result.}

These displays take different forms depending on the purpose for which the graphic is being constructed (e.g., for thinking or communication), characteristics of the data, potential visual display forms, and whether or not the information graphic is interactive. Choosing an appropriate method for representing data requires a basic understanding of the perceptual and cognitive processing that occurs in the human visual system. Information graphics can be constructed using a wide array of tools, but are increasingly constructed using computer code and distributed through the internet.}

abstract = {If O2 is for I, then what is O2 for AI? What is oxygen for humans is what is object-oriented thinking for artificial intelligent systems. Much the same way as humans need O2 knowingly or unknowingly, the first step in designing an AI system requires the application of object-oriented principles either explicitly or implicitly. The basis of the definition of state in AI is a description of the concept of interest as an object with properties. The idea of an object extends beyond typical noun forms that describe elements of the real world. The verb forms are included as well with -able suffixes such as runnable, serializable, and executable. In the software world, the first step in modeling a business requirement is the identification of objects of interest and defining their properties and interactions. For instance, in the case of web services, a service is an object; in the case of database systems, a table or a transaction is an object; or in the case of large-scale integration, electronic components are objects. The concept of an object extends beyond the software realm and into the mathematical world in an implicit form. Functional analysis is an old topic in mathematics where each function is an object indeed. The concept of space in mathematics relates closely to the possible value ranges of all attributes of an object. Mathematical operators are the same as methods of objects. It is day-to-day practical life in any modern operating system software dealing with process objects and applications such as Python scripts involving function objects. In this chapter, the application of object-oriented thinking to convert a business requirement to a machine learning (ML) formulation is presented with examples. The five steps of supervised ML formulation based on vector representations of input and output, mapping function, loss function, and data set are clarified. The scope and limitation of ML formulation as against general AI methodology are discussed to demystify popular myths. This chapter also reveals the secret behind the success of deep learning methodology as automatic differentiation involving function objects.}

abstract = {Examining who (and what) stands to gain and lose in the smart city, and what kind of urban life smart cities create, are questions of a philosophical and ethical import. Since the early 2010s scholars and journalists have critiqued the smart city paradigm and examined its various projects and experimental initiatives to surface its ethical dimensions and significance. The smart city's rhetorical swing from tech-centric to human-centric and from smart city to smart citizen is construed here as a further effort to create the image of a more ethical smart city. Consequently, the topic of ethics has also intersected with the smart city in particular ways, and predominantly through the lens of data governance and the protection of privacy rights. This chapter argues for an expanded approach to smart city ethics. It proposes a focus on urban technology design to bridge the gap between a micro-ethical focus on data ethics and macro-level political-ethical critique. Bringing philosophical thinking on technology together with a design-led approach to urban technology is argued to provide a further way to draw out a potentially different set of ethical concerns and to explore how urban life can be lived with technology.}

abstract = {A large number of computational models of information processing in the basal ganglia have been developed in recent years. Prominent in these are actor–critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor–critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to ‘evolve’ an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor–critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia–thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.}

Here we use computational modelling to evaluate evidence from two psychophysical studies collectively thought to demonstrate the existence of three separate and independent motion processing channels. We show that the pattern of psychophysical results can largely be accounted for by a single mechanism. The results demonstrate that a low-level luminance based approach can potentially provide a wider account of human motion processing than generally thought possible.}
