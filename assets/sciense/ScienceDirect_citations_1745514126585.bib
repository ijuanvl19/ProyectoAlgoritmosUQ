abstract = {This study is a digital form-finding and manual fabrication experiment in woven architectural design, with one traditional weaving style, Kagome, used to scale the craft up into an architectural-scale bamboo woven artifact. Kagome is a trihexagonal pattern employed in traditional bamboo basketry as a triaxial weaving system, resulting in an object with a self-bracing capacity without the use of fasteners owing to its interlacing lattices. Although existing studies and tools have addressed triaxial weaving design and representation, the current consideration of the advantages of weaving with bamboo is insufficient. To address this research gap, this study develops a computational design method based on studies on bamboo basketry. This allows for the representation and exploration of design geometries using combinations of regular triangular meshes for the fabrication of Kagome woven bamboo artifacts. A full-scale mock-up was fabricated to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The mock-up demonstrated the self-bracing properties of Kagome, but there were discrepancies between the mock-up and the design. Factors affecting bamboo weaving on an architectural scale have been identified within this study to inform future research on woven bamboo structures.}

abstract = {Patrick Geddes articulated the growth and design of cities in the early years of the town planning movement in Britain using biological principles of which Darwin’s (1859) theory of evolution was central. His ideas about social evolution, the design of local communities, and his repeated calls for comprehensive understanding through regional survey and plan laid the groundwork for much practical planning in the mid 20th century, both with respect to an embryonic theory of cities and the practice of planning. But Geddes had a much wider agenda that town planning per se. He sought after a philosophy of life that went well beyond Darwinism verging almost on the spiritual at times. Yet his personal approach and the limits he imposed on his formal thinking meant that he was never able to establish his big picture in a way that later generations could easily grasp and build upon. He left us with enticing ideas, evocative phrases, and a practical philosophy of doing planning and building communities that has indeed survived as something more than a footnote in history. In this essay, we identify the key paradox of modern planning which seeks to intervene in systems that have enormous complexity, growing and evolving rather than being designed in any top-down fashion. We illustrate this paradox through Geddes’ own career and life in which this tension between bottom up and top down was always to the forefront. We then sketch his influence on practicing planners and key intellectuals of the mid to late 20th century—Abercrombie and Mumford, Jacobs and Alexander. We bring this history of Geddes’ influence up to contemporary times when the complexity sciences with all their focus on evolving systems, now permeate our thinking, suggesting various ways in which we might examine the history of the planning in the last 100 years in a new light through the lens of Geddes’ arguments and principles}

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is characterised by the heterogeneous cellular kinetic profile seen across patients. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which displays predictable dose-exposure relationships resulting from well-understood pharmacokinetic processes, CAR T-cell dynamics rely on complex biologic factors that condition treatment response. Computational approaches hold potential to explore the intricate cellular dynamics arising from CAR T therapy, yet their ability to improve cancer treatment remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive framework through which to understand, construct, and classify CAR T-cell kinetics models. Current approaches often rely on adapted empirical pharmacokinetic methods that overlook dynamics emerging from cellular interactions, or intricate theoretical multi-population models with limited clinical applicability. Our review shows that the utility of a model does not depend on the complexity of its design but on the strategic selection of its biological constituents, implementation of suitable mathematical tools, and the availability of biological measures from which to fit the model.}

However, due to their complexity, understanding underlying developmental mechanisms is challenging. Elsewhere in neurobiology, a computational revolution has shown that mathematical models of hidden biological mechanisms can bridge observations with theory building. Can we build a similar computational framework yielding mechanistic insights for brain development? Here, we outline the conceptual and technical challenges of addressing this theory gap, and demonstrate that there is great potential in specifying brain development as mathematically defined processes operating within physical constraints. We provide examples, alongside broader ingredients needed, as the field explores computational explanations of system-wide development.}

Constructal law is the thermodynamic theory based on the analysis of fluxes across the boundaries of an open system. Protocells, as dynamic, autopoietic and adaptive open finite size systems, serve in this paper as a compelling metaphor and design model for responsive and sustainable manmade architectural and urban environments. The ability of protocells to harness energy, minimize entropy, and adapt to environmental changes mirrors the principles of constructal thermodynamics, which govern the flow and distribution of resources in complex self-organizing information open systems in nature. By applying these principles to digital architecture, this study investigates how relational dynamics between spaces, materials, and functions can create adaptive designs that “go with the flow” of ecological and cultural systems. The research demonstrates using the Gouy-Stodola theorem as a variational principle, how protocell-inspired processes facilitate exergy-efficient designs, minimizing waste while maximizing resilience and flexibility. The present paper argues -through an applied case study- for a paradigm where protocell digital architecture serves not only as an ecological and material model but mainly as a spatial narrative driver, blending constructal and digital tools with cultural mythos. Finally, this paper exploring simultaneously the semantic complexity and ontology of such systems, in turn, connects these constructal driven digital designs to broader poly-narratives, embedding cultural, symbolic, philosophical and functional predicates into architectural forms.}

In two experiments, we manipulated how 3- to 5-year-olds responded to counterfactual conditional and syllogism tasks. In Experiment 1 (N=39), children’s performance improved on both conditional and syllogism tasks when they responded with an arrow rather than pointing with a finger. In Experiment 2 (N=42), 3- and 4-year-olds benefited from both an arrow manipulation and, separately, the introduction of a delay before responding. We suggest that both manipulations help children to overcome an impulsive prepotent response to counterfactual questions arising from a default assumption that information about the past is true.}

The results, based on a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the students’ achievements, indicate that they demonstrated computational thinking competencies at various levels.

In this method analytes are propelled by an external applied voltage towards the sensor until they are trapped at the DNH-ssNP interface via a self-induced back action (SIBA) plasmonic force. We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here, we extend this method to AC sensing of 20 nm SiO2 (silica) nanoparticles, using voltage modulation over a wide range of frequencies applied on top of a baseline DC bias. The sensor was constructed using two-beam GFIS Focused Ion Beam (FIB) lithography, incorporating Ne FIB to mill the DNH and He FIB to drill a central 30 nm ssNP. We utilized COMSOL Multiphysics simulations to explore the multi-frequency AC current conductance properties of the silica nanoparticles trapped at the SANE sensor. These simulations computed conductance changes and phase shifts induced by the presence of the nanoparticle over an AC frequency range of 20 Hz to 100 kHz. Experimental measurements confirmed the trends seen in the computational data. Additional computational studies were then performed to dissect the underlying mechanisms driving the observed AC measurements. Looking forward, we aim to adapt this technology for probing therapeutic nanoparticles non-invasively, offering a promising tool for enhancing quality control of nanoparticle-mediated drug and gene delivery systems.}

Results showed that thinking styles and personality traits statistically overlap. However, this overlap is limited. Two major arguments are made. First, thinking styles make a unique contribution to the understanding of human individual differences. Second, the necessity for measuring thinking styles apart from measuring personality traits depends on who uses the inventories and for what purposes.}

abstract = {Humans have evolved mechanisms for the detection and management of possible threats in order to abate their negative consequences for fitness. Internally generated (‘detached’) cognition may have evolved in part because of its contributions to this broad function, but important questions remain about its role in threat management. In this article, we therefore present a taxonomy of threat-related internally generated cognition comprising episodic and semantic formats of memory and prospection. We address the proximate mechanisms of each of the capacities in this taxonomy, and discuss their respective contributions to adaptive threat management in humans. For instance, mental time travel empowers people to contemplate and learn from threats experienced long ago, as well as to plan for dangers that might arise in the distant future. However, despite their functional benefits, these thought processes are also central to contemporary anxiety disorders and may be a potent source of distress.}

The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.}

abstract = {The momentary, global functional state of the brain is reflected by its electric field configuration. Cluster analytical approaches consistently extracted four head-surface brain electric field configurations that optimally explain the variance of their changes across time in spontaneous EEG recordings. These four configurations are referred to as EEG microstate classes A, B, C, and D and have been associated with verbal/phonological, visual, subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing, and attention reorientation, respectively. The present study tested these associations via an intra-individual and inter-individual analysis approach. The intra-individual approach tested the effect of task-induced increased modality-specific processing on EEG microstate parameters. The inter-individual approach tested the effect of personal modality-specific parameters on EEG microstate parameters. We obtained multichannel EEG from 61 healthy, right-handed, male students during four eyes-closed conditions: object-visualization, spatial-visualization, verbalization (6 runs each), and resting (7 runs). After each run, we assessed participants' degrees of object-visual, spatial-visual, and verbal thinking using subjective reports. Before and after the recording, we assessed modality-specific cognitive abilities and styles using nine cognitive tests and two questionnaires. The EEG of all participants, conditions, and runs was clustered into four classes of EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D). RMANOVAs, ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests compared microstate parameters between conditions. TANOVAs compared microstate class topographies between conditions. Differences were localized using eLORETA. Pearson correlations assessed interrelationships between personal modality-specific parameters and EEG microstate parameters during no-task resting. As hypothesized, verbal as opposed to visual conditions consistently affected the duration, occurrence, and coverage of microstate classes A and B. Contrary to associations suggested by previous reports, parameters were increased for class A during visualization, and class B during verbalization. In line with previous reports, microstate D parameters were increased during no-task resting compared to the three internal, goal-directed tasks. Topographic differences between conditions included particular sub-regions of components of the metabolic default mode network. Modality-specific personal parameters did not consistently correlate with microstate parameters except verbal cognitive style which correlated negatively with microstate class A duration and positively with class C occurrence. This is the first study that aimed to induce EEG microstate class parameter changes based on their hypothesized functional significance. Beyond the associations of microstate classes A and B with visual and verbal processing, respectively, our results suggest that a finely-tuned interplay between all four EEG microstate classes is necessary for the continuous formation of visual and verbal thoughts. Our results point to the possibility that the EEG microstate classes may represent the head-surface measured activity of intra-cortical sources primarily exhibiting inhibitory functions. However, additional studies are needed to verify and elaborate on this hypothesis.}

abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders present a significant challenge in modern healthcare due to their complex and diverse manifestations. The beginning of computational intelligence has revolutionized the diagnostic landscape, offering promising ways for early and accurate detection of these debilitating conditions. Machine learning algorithms, a subset of computational intelligence, have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing extensive datasets comprising genetic, imaging, and clinical information. Furthermore, computational intelligence facilitates the integration of multimodal data, integrating information from genetic profiles, brain imaging (MRI, PET scans), and clinical assessments. This consolidative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and aids in the development of predictive models for early medical assessment and prediction of the outcome. Moreover, the utilization of computational intelligence in neuroimaging analysis has shown remarkable potential. Advanced image processing techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms enable the detection of structural and functional abnormalities in the brain, often serving as precursors to neurodegenerative disorders. This chapter explores the key role of computational intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, etc. In conclusion, computational intelligence offers a transformative framework for advancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Embracing and refining these computational tools will undoubtedly overlay the way for more effective interventions and personalized medicine in the fight against these challenging conditions.}

Specifically, the model simulates students' cognition as they complete activities within a science classroom. This study also seeks to examine the effects, as evidenced in the ANN, of an intervention designed to develop increased levels of critical thinking related to science skills. This model is based on the identification of cognitive attributes and integration of two advanced measurement frameworks: cognitive diagnostics and Item Response Theory. Both frameworks examine student response patterns, providing initial inputs for the ANN portion of the model. Once initial task response patterns are identified, they are parameterized and presented to the ANN. The ANN within this study is the foundational component of a computational model based upon the interaction of multiple, connected, adaptive processing elements know as cognitive attributes. These cognitive attributes process student responses to cognitive tasks within science tasks. Using the Student Task and Cognition Model (STAC-M), the study authors simulated a cognitive training intervention using a randomized control trial design of 100,000 students. Results of the simulation suggest that it is possible to increase levels of student success using a targeted cognitive attribute approach and that computational modeling provides a means to test educational theory for future education research. The paper also discusses limitations of the use of this computational model within education and the possible future directions for educators and researchers.}

Radical connectionism claims that cognition never implicates an internal symbolic medium, not even when natural language plays a part in our thought processes. On the face of it, such a position renders the human capacity for abstract thought quite mysterious. However, we argue that connectionism is committed to an analog conception of neural computation, and that representation of the abstract is no more problematic for a system of analog vehicles than for a symbol system. Natural language is therefore not required as a representational medium for abstract thought. Since natural language is arguably not a representational medium at all, but a conventionally governed scheme of communicative signals, we suggest that the role of internalised (i.e. self-directed) language is best conceived in terms of the coordination and control of cognitive activities within the brain.}

However, recent findings suggest that there can also be a positive correlation between cognitive capacity and correct intuitive thinking. Here we present results from 2 studies that directly contrasted whether cognitive capacity is more predictive of having correct intuitions or successful deliberate correction of an incorrect intuition. We used a two-response paradigm in which people were required to give a fast intuitive response under time pressure and cognitive load and afterwards were given the time to deliberate. We used a direction-of change analysis to check whether correct responses were generated intuitively or whether they resulted from deliberate correction (i.e., an initial incorrect-to-correct final response change). Results showed that although cognitive capacity was associated with the correction tendency (overall r = 0.22) it primarily predicted correct intuitive responding (overall r = 0.44). These findings force us to rethink the nature of sound reasoning and the role of cognitive capacity in reasoning. Rather than being good at deliberately correcting erroneous intuitions, smart reasoners simply seem to have more accurate intuitions.}

This is demonstrated through four simulated cases centred on the proposed Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). This is achieved by two-way coupling the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM and the Computational Thermodynamics (CT) code Thermochimica, using the Joint Research Centre Molten Salt Database (JRCMSD). Local chemical equilibrium is assumed, implying that chemical kinetics are predominantly governed by mass transport. Four simulations address normal operating conditions, exploring: (i) dilution of fission products injected within the molten salt coolant, (ii) molten salt coolant evaporation rate, (iii) release of radioactive gaseous species, (iv) shifts in the UF4/UF3 ratio, and (v) comparison of vapour pressures of gaseous species. The influence of temperature-dependent viscosity on retaining fission products, compared to consistent values, is also discussed. The feasibility of integrating CFD with Thermochimica showed promising results, broadening insights into multiphysics systems and setting the stage for its application in more intricate scenarios.}

Survey based stated preference methods, such as discrete choice experiments (DCEs), are used to elicit preferences for non-market goods. A critique of stated preference research is that respondents to hypothetical surveys may not provide careful and thoughtful responses that reveal rational preferences. Choice certainty has been used to measure survey respondents' task engagement. Researchers assume that respondents who are certain about their choices provide deliberative responses. In the case of DCE, we argue that the variability of choice certainty is also important. We present a novel framework to identify thoughtful / deliberative respondents. The framework combines respondents’ certainty with their variability in certainty across a set of choice tasks. We test our framework empirically using data from two case studies. We find respondents with higher mean certainty and variability (i) seldom use decision heuristics, (ii) are more likely to have monotonic preferences, (iii) have longer response times, (iv) make choices that have higher interval validity, and (v) have higher choice consistency. We discuss the relevance of alternative ex-post calibration strategies with a view to improve the precision and accuracy of DCE-based welfare estimates.}

Neuroimaging research so far has focused on episodic prospection, or thinking about hypothetical future personal events. What has received no attention is semantic prospection or contemplating hypothetical future world events. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show a number of functional dissociations in the brain when comparing future and past thinking across personal and non-personal conceptual domains. In the prefrontal cortex, the processes of information integration and self-referential thinking in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex were differentiated from those pertaining to generative construction along the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and adjoining regions in the superior frontal gyrus. Dorsal parts of the lateral inferior parietal lobe showed lateralization effects as a function of the divergent or convergent nature of the retrieval process corresponding to whether the accessed information referred to hypothetical or real events. While ventral parts of the bilateral inferior parietal lobe were preferentially engaged during both personal past and personal future thinking, dissociations between the areas involved in personal past versus personal future thinking were found along the medial parietal wall. All in all, these findings provide novel and critical insights into the complex interactions between different processes involved in prospective and retrospective thought as modulated by the type of processed content.}

abstract = {Relational reasoning (RR) and divergent thinking (DT) are two critical antecedents of creative problem solving, but the relation between them is not currently well understood psychologically, limiting efforts to support these constructs through education. The threshold hypothesis (TH) is currently the dominant explanation for the relation between RR and DT, and posits that RR fundamentally supports DT, but only up to a point. In this study, quantile regression was used to test the TH among RR and two separate dimensions of DT: originality and fluency. Results generally supported the TH in regards to originality, with RR being significantly positively related to originality, but only in students at or below the median of the originality distribution. However, the TH was not upheld for fluency, which was only significantly predicted by RR at the top (i.e. 9th decile) of the fluency distribution. In general, results suggest that direct instructional intervention of RR strategies may be most supportive of creativity for those students who are simultaneously highly fluent but low-original thinkers.}

Of the non-Newtonian models, the Williamson fluid best reflects shear-thinning properties; nonetheless, its non-linear governing equations provide major difficulties for conventional numerical methods. This work tackles these issues by suggesting a unique two-stage explicit computational method to solve the time-dependent flow of Williamson fluid through a Darcy-Forchheimer porous media under the effect of thermal radiation and an angled magnetic field. The approach uses a compact finite difference method for space (sixth-order accuracy) and a modified exponential integrator for time discretization (second-order accuracy). Including internal heat generation and chemical reaction, the model is nondimensionalized and solved under unsteady boundary conditions. The suggested approach shows better accuracy and lower numerical error when compared to the classical second-order Runge-Kutta scheme. Key results show that although larger reaction rates result in lower concentration, more velocity is produced by raising the Darcy number and lowering the magnetic field intensity. Apart from presenting a quick numerical framework, the paper offers physical insights on regulating transport phenomena in complicated porous and electromagnetic settings, suggesting uses in thermal management, fluid processing, and MHD systems.}

abstract = {Thinking about what might have been—counterfactual thinking—is a common feature of the mental landscape. Key questions about counterfactual thinking center on why and how they occur and what downstream cognitive and behavioral outcomes they engender. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking aims to answer these and other questions by drawing connections to goal cognition and by specifying distinct functions that counterfactuals may serve, including preparing for goal pursuit and regulating affect. Since the publication of our last theoretical statement (Epstude & Roese, 2008), numerous lines of empirical evidence support, or are rendered more readily understandable, when glimpsed through the lens of the functional theory. However, other lines of evidence have called into question the very basis of the theory. We integrate a broad range of findings spanning several psychological disciplines so as to present an updated version of the functional theory. We integrate findings from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and health psychology that support the claim that episodic counterfactual thoughts are geared mainly toward preparation and goal striving and are generally beneficial for individuals. Counterfactuals may influence behavior via either a content-specific pathway (in which the counterfactual insight informs behavior change) or a content-neutral pathway (in which the negative affect from the counterfactual motivates generic behavior change). Challenges to the functional theory of counterfactual thinking center on whether counterfactuals typically cohere to a structural form amenable to goal striving and whether behavioral consequences are mainly dysfunctional rather than functional. Integrating both supporting and challenging evidence, we offer a new theoretical synthesis intended to clarify the literature and guide future research in multiple disciplines of psychology.}

This idea explains both rational and irrational motivations. In this paper, we revisit visual comprehension tasks based on this idea. At the theoretical level, we focus on the relationship between intuitive thinking, prior knowledge, and environmental information, and build a causal graph between the three. Further, inspired by the constructed causal graph, an intuitive optimization strategy with clear interpretability is proposed. In the validation session, we provide conclusions consistent with the theoretical analyses through extensive experiments on public datasets based on a visual quizzing task. Excitingly, our scheme demonstrates strong competitiveness in terms of generalizability without adding new technologies.}

More recently, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory (GIST; Vigo, 2013, 2015; Vigo et al., 2022) has extended this methodological trajectory with respect to the study and formal modeling of human cognition. Indeed, GIST is the first systematic and extensively tested mathematical and computational theory of concept learning and categorization behavior (i.e., human generalization) based on such principles. The theory introduces an original mathematical and computational framework, with novel, more appropriate, and more natural characterizations, constructs, and measures of invariance and symmetry with respect to cognition than existing ones in the mathematical sciences and physics. These have proven effective in predicting and explaining empirically tested behavior in the domains of perception, concept learning, categorization, similarity assessment, aesthetic judgments, and decision making, among others. GIST has its roots in a precursor theory known as Categorical Invariance Theory (CIT; Vigo, 2009). This paper gives a basic introduction to two different notions of human invariance detection proposed by GIST and its precursor CIT: namely, a notion based on a cognitive mechanism of dimensional suppression, rapid attention shifting, and partial similarity assessment referred to as binding (s-invariance) and a perturbation notion based on perturbations of the values of the dimensions on which categories of object stimuli are defined (p-invariance). This is followed by the first simple formal proof of the invariance equivalence principle from GIST which asserts that the two notions are equivalent under a set of strict conditions on categories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how GIST, unlike CIT, may be used to model probabilistic process accounts of categorization, and how it naturally and directly applies to the learning of sequential categories and to multiset-based concept learning.}

abstract = {Background
A Wellbeing Economy describes an economic system that places the wellbeing of current and future generations at its core, with the economy seen as a means to improved health, collective wellbeing and environmental sustainability. This paper reports our experiences of, and learning from, creating systems thinking, analysis and modelling tools for use by policy actors, and of forging university-policy partnerships to drive transformative action towards health and wellbeing.
Methods
The Systems Science in Public Health and Health Economics Research (SIPHER) works through co-production partnerships with local (Sheffield City Council), regional (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) and national (Scottish Government; Public Health Scotland) policy organisations. We designed, deployed, and triangulated between, different methods to gain an in-depth understanding of the respective policy systems, including: policy and stakeholder analysis, interviews; participatory systems mapping workshops; evidence gap mapping; dynamic spatial microsimulation and system dynamic modelling; elicitation of public preferences across different wellbeing economy outcomes; a decision support infrastructure; and community panels to shape and scrutinise our work.
Findings
Our focus was on exploring the public health and equity impacts of housing, income, work and community wealth building policies, including in response to pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and fuel poverty. Qualitative systems methods were particularly useful in articulating the multiple goals and priorities of a policy system around a shared, cohesive wellbeing narrative. Computational modelling and decision tools provided insights into targeting options, visualising trade-offs between different policy priorities (eg, overall health gains, equity gains or policy cost).
Interpretation
Co-produced qualitative analyses, data, computational models, and decision tools aided deeper exploration of systemic effects, including feedback processes and co-benefits/trade-offs that link such policies to future health and wellbeing. The process of applying diverse systems methods also led to a broadening of researcher perspectives, shifting ways-of-doing and facilitating both cross-disciplinary and cross-sector discussion and collaboration.

abstract = {The mechanisms of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are often investigated in fully formed illness, well after symptoms emerge. These investigations have yielded key insights but are not well positioned to reveal the dynamic forces underlying symptom formation itself. Understanding symptom development over time would allow us to identify steps in the pathophysiological process leading to psychosis, shifting the focus of psychiatric intervention from symptom alleviation to prevention. We propose a model for understanding the emergence of psychotic symptoms within the context of an adaptive, developing neural system. We make the case for a pathophysiological process that begins with cortical hyperexcitability and bottom-up noise transmission, which engenders inappropriate belief formation via aberrant prediction error signaling. We argue that this bottom-up noise drives learning about the (im)precision of new incoming sensory information because of diminished signal-to-noise ratio, causing a compensatory relative overreliance on prior beliefs. This overreliance on priors predisposes to hallucinations and covaries with hallucination severity. An overreliance on priors may also lead to increased conviction in the beliefs generated by bottom-up noise and drive movement toward conversion to psychosis. We identify predictions of our model at each stage, examine evidence to support or refute those predictions, and propose experiments that could falsify or help select between alternative elements of the overall model. Nesting computational abnormalities within longitudinal development allows us to account for hidden dynamics among the mechanisms driving symptom formation and to view established symptoms as a point of equilibrium among competing biological forces.}

In addition to physical security, cyber security becomes a significant concern for NPPs since swift digitalization and overreliance on computer-based systems in the facility operations transformed NPPs into targets for cyber/physical attacks. Despite technical competencies, humans are still the central component of a resilient NPP to develop an effective nuclear security culture. Turkey is one of the newcomers in the nuclear energy industry, and Turkish Akkuyu NPP has a unique model owned by an international consortium. Since Turkey has limited experience in nuclear energy industry, specific multinational and multicultural characteristics of Turkish Akkuyu NPP also requires further research in terms of the Facility's prospective nuclear security. Yet, the link between “national cultures” and “nuclear security” is underestimated in nuclear security studies. By relying on Hofstede's national culture framework, our research aims to address this gap and explore possible implications of cross-national cultural differences on nuclear security. To cope with security challenges in the age of hybrid threats, we propose a security management model which addresses the need for cyber-physical security integration to cultivate a robust nuclear security culture in a multicultural working environment.}

This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

In addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers’ views in relation to the use of coding toys in ECEC and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as children’s development after play activities with coding toys. The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children’s development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. As an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers.}

The emergent design evaluation theory was used to evaluate the design and implementation of a high school biology unit integrating computational thinking and neural engineering, including teacher professional development and a web-based application. A contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. Consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. By demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context.}

We identify the main business significance of mental network simulations in terms of their utility to clarify ambiguous or only partially known focal network situations, to develop coherent focal net plans and tactics, and to mentally preview how specific focal net tactics/strategies are likely to play out in reality. In short, mental network simulations were observed as being useful in generating focal net action through cognitively meeting the complex environmental challenges in dynamic focal net interaction between companies.}

The slowly resolving reproducibility crisis presents both a sobering warning and an opportunity to iterate on what science and data processing entails. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the world’s largest radio telescope, is among the most extensive scientific projects underway and presents grand scientific collaboration and data-processing challenges. In this work, we aim to improve the ability of workflow management systems to facilitate reproducible, high-quality science. This work presents a scale and system-agnostic computational workflow model and extends five well-known reproducibility concepts into seven well-defined tenets for this workflow model. Additionally, we present a method to construct workflow execution signatures using cryptographic primitives in amortized constant time. We combine these three concepts and provide a concrete implementation in Data Activated Flow Graph Engine (DALiuGE), a workflow management system for the SKA to embed specific provenance information into workflow signatures, demonstrating the possibility of facilitating automatic formal verification of scientific quality in amortized constant time. We validate our approach with a simple yet representative astronomical processing task: filtering a noisy signal with a lowpass filter using CPU and GPU methods. This example shows the practicality and efficacy of combining formal tenet definitions with a workflow signature generation mechanism. Our framework, spanning formal UML specification, principled provenance information collection based on reproducibility tenets, and finally, a concrete example implementation in DALiuGE illuminates otherwise obscure scientific discrepancies and similarities between principally identical workflow executions.}

In online tutoring, synchrony fosters better comprehension and engagement. Despite numerous methods to measure synchrony—such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic alignment—systematic comparisons across these approaches remain limited, impeding a full understanding of how synchrony operates across different educational contexts. This study addresses this gap by analyzing tutoring conversations from diverse contexts, particularly English as a Second Language (ESL) tutoring and algebra instruction, using seven computational models. These models yielded 29 synchrony indices, ranging from traditional lexical overlap to advanced natural language processing-based embedding models, capturing synchrony across multiple dimensions. Our results show that while these methods generally align with theoretical dimensions of synchrony, variations in embedding methods and distance measures can significantly impact their ability to capture meaningful interactions. Additionally, different subject domains influenced the finer-grained dimensions of synchrony observed, particularly in temporal aspects.}

For the engineering methodology, the current book emphasizes the combination between reductionism and holism theory, between analysis and integration, and between virtuality and substantiality. The new generation of the steel manufacturing process is proposed based on the thinking mode above. The thinking mode above clarifies that thinking and studying a new generation of the steel manufacturing process should neither consider things as its standard nor tend to the specific application of individual technology. The general theoretical study of integrity, openness, hierarchy, dynamic character in the steel manufacturing process is more important. The old method of figurative observation should be turned to the physical nature investigation of dynamic running process. Based on the rational abstract, concept research, top level design, the dynamic tailored design study and dynamic operation rules, etc., are performed. Thus the concept, connotation, function, design method, and operation rules of a new generation of the steel manufacturing process are established.}

However, using the tradition to explain modern speech behaviours raises the question of whether the understanding of modesty has remained the same over time. This study explores the metalanguage of modesty in historical and modern Chinese, to reveal what has indeed been inherited and what has changed in its understanding. It employs two computational methods, together with qualitative analysis, to examine corpus data where Chinese modesty lexemes, qianxu and qianxun, are used. Findings show that modesty remains to be a virtue and an interpersonal tactic at the abstract level over time. However, reciprocal and repeated practices of modesty, which were once ritualized in historical Chinese, largely ceased in modern Chinese. Self-effacement serves different sociopragmatic functions, and attention-avoidance behaviours are increasingly associated with modesty nowadays. More importantly, modesty in modern Chinese has been patterned with social qualities and practices that have not been identified in historical Chinese. The change reflects an influence of political propaganda in China.}

Such behaviors exploit ambiguity and under-specification in language. Using loopholes is commonplace and intuitive in everyday social interaction, both familiar and consequential. Loopholes are also of concern in the law, and increasingly in artificial intelligence. However, the computational and cognitive underpinnings of loopholes are not well understood. Here, we propose a utility-theoretic recursive social reasoning model that formalizes and accounts for loophole behavior. The model captures the decision process of a loophole-aware listener, who trades off their own utility with that of the speaker, and considers an expected social penalty for non-cooperative behavior. The social penalty is computed through the listener’s recursive reasoning about a virtual naive observer’s inference of a naive listener’s social intent. Our model captures qualitative patterns in previous data, and also generates new quantitative predictions consistent with novel studies (N = 265).

The focus of this study chapter is to conduct a comprehensive investigation of a heuristic strategy based on computational intelligence. The objective of this technique is to optimism energy efficiency in the context of sustainable transportation. The urgent need to decrease the environmental impact of transport systems, along with the increasing expenses of energy use, highlights the utmost importance of this study activity. Within this particular setting, the chapter effectively creates a thorough and robust basis by undertaking an intensive analysis of relevant literature. This evaluation encompasses a wide variety of issues, including sustainable transportation practice's and computational intelligence methodologies. The purpose of this extensive literature study is to identify existing research gaps and limitations, which supports the justification for the innovative heuristic method being examined. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical foundations of computational intelligence and its potential application in the field of energy efficiency optimization's. The methodology section elucidates the complexities of the heuristic approach, providing a comprehensive account of how computational intelligence algorithms are incorporated to develop novel ways for conserving energy in transportation. The next sections will explore the presentation and analysis of actual data, demonstrating concrete outcomes and highlighting the advantages gained by using the computational intelligence method. The validity of this study is shown by the use of visual depictions, empirical data, and numerical measures, which provide a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of the technique. The subsequent discourse offers an advanced analysis of the study results, identifying subtle ramifications and pragmatic uses. Additionally, a comparison study is performed in relation to traditional approaches, which demonstrates the improved energy efficiency and environmental effect mitigation obtained by the use of computational intelligence.

abstract = {Consumers often have to decide whether to make an effort and go to a remote store rather than a nearby one in order to obtain a lower price. Only the absolute price difference between the stores should be relevant in this case, but several experiments showed that people exhibit “relative thinking”: they are affected also by the relative savings (relative to the good’s price). This article analyzes the effects of this bias on firm strategy and market outcomes using a two-period game-theoretic model of location differentiation. Relative thinking causes consumers to make less effort to save a constant amount when they buy more expensive goods. In the location differentiation context this behavior can be modeled by consumers who behave as if their transportation costs are an increasing function of the good’s price. This gives firms an additional incentive to raise prices, in order to increase the perceived transportation costs of consumers, which consequently softens competition and allows higher profits. Therefore, the response of firms to relative thinking raises prices and profits and reduces consumer surplus, in both periods. Total welfare is unchanged in the first period, and in the second period it is either unchanged or reduced, depending on whether the objective or subjective transportation costs are used to compute welfare. The main results of the model (firms’ response to relative thinking increases prices and reduces consumer surplus) are likely to hold also in the context of search. The article also explains why “relative thinking” is a more appropriate term than “mental accounting” (which was often used before) to describe this behavior, and discusses why people might exhibit relative thinking.}

This paper reports on some preliminary findings from a research project where two elementary teachers in an urban New Zealand school introduced Scratch to nine and ten year old children in their classrooms. In each of the classrooms a small number of computers and an interactive whiteboard (IWB) were utilised. This paper uses a case study approach to describe how engagement with Scratch and independent use of the IWB enabled children to work collaboratively to solve design challenges. Initial results indicate that the Scratch program is engaging for children. It created an environment where the children were, by necessity, using problem-solving processes such as goal setting, and generating and testing of ideas. The interactive whiteboard afforded rich opportunities for children to collaborate and share their thinking. Some questions and implications for the learning and teaching of elementary school mathematics are explored at the conclusion of the paper.}

However, there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist, such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills, and not just learning the code syntax. The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account.}

In particular, we were interested in whether self-regulated learning (SRL; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000) processing was related to the acquisition of declarative knowledge and historical thinking. We found that, using the HLE, participants did learn from pretest to posttest, and that they most often engaged in strategy use SRL processes. However, the frequency of participant use of planning SRL processes, not strategy use, was predictive of learning. This study has implications for how educators use HLEs to foster historical thinking skills, and suggests that scaffolding planning skills may facilitate students’ use of computers as cognitive and metacognitive tools for learning (Azevedo, 2005; Lajoie, 2000).}

Hence, future research could focus on developing more practical RO tools for application to the energy industry, thus making the utilization of powerful “real options thinking” for decision making under uncertainty more widespread. This is particularly important for applications in low carbon power and energy systems with increasing renewable and sustainable energy resources, given the different types of uncertainty they are facing in the transition towards a truly Smart Grid. In order to do so, and based on an extensive relevant literature review, the analogies with financial options are first presented, with various assumptions and their validity being clearly discussed in order to understand if, when, and how specific methods can be applied. It is then argued how option theory is in most cases not directly applicable to investment in energy systems but requires the consideration of their physical characteristics. The paper finally gives recommendations for building practical RO approaches to energy system (and potentially all engineering) project investments under uncertainty, regardless of the scale, time frame, or type of uncertainty involved.}

Nexus Informatics develops the science of recognising and quantifying nexus interlinkages. Nexus-coherent solutions enhance the effect of policymaking in achieving adequate governance, leading to successful strategic vision and efficient resource management. In this article, we present the structure of a System Dynamics Model—the Nexus_SDM—that maps sector-specific data from major databases (e.g., EUROSTAT) and scenario models (e.g., E3ME-FTT OSeMOSYS and SWIM) for the national case study of Greece. Disaggregation algorithms are employed on annual national-scale data, turning them into detailed spatial and temporal datasets, by converting them to monthly values spread among all 14 River Basin Districts (RBDs). The Nexus_SDM calculates Nexus Interlinkage Factors and quantifies interlinkages among Water, Energy, Food, Built Environment, Natural Land and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It simulates the nexus in the national case study of Greece as a holistic multi-sectoral system and provides insights into the vulnerability of resources to future socio-economic scenarios. It calculates the link between crop type/area, irrigation water and agricultural value, revealing which crops have the highest agricultural value with the least water and crop area. It demonstrates that fossil fuel power generation and use of oil for transportation are responsible for the most GHG emissions in most RBDs and presents projections for years 2030 and 2050. The analysis showcases that to move from a general nexus thinking to an operational nexus concept, it is important to focus on data availability and scale. Advanced Sankey and Chord diagrams are introduced to show distribution of resource use among RBDs and an innovative visualisation tool is developed, the Nexus Directional Chord plot, which reveals Nexus hotspots and strong interlinkages among sectors, facilitating stakeholder awareness.}

Here we investigated the associations of creativity measured by divergent thinking (CMDT) with resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures and their sex differences. We examined these relationships in the brains of 1277 healthy young adults. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant interaction between verbal CMDT and sex on (a) regional homogeneity within an area from the left anterior temporal lobe (b) on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus and (c) on fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in several distinct areas, including the precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and cerebellum. These interactions were mediated by positive correlations in females and negative correlations in males. These findings suggest that greater CMDT in females is reflected by (a) regional coherence (regional homogeneity) of brain areas responsible for representing and combining concepts as well as (b) the efficient functional connection (RSFC) between the key areas for the default state of cognitive activity and speech production, and (c) greater spontaneous neural activity (fALFF) during the resting of brain areas involved in frontal lobe functions, default cognitive activities, and language functions. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the associations between creativity and resting state brain connectivity patterns are different between males and females.}

Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems.}

A rationale for teaching for thinking is that students are expected to be effective thinkers but rarely are taught how to think. Teaching for thinking is intended to promote the ability to use what one has learned to solve new problems, which Wertheimer refers to as productive thinking. Teaching for thinking requires the consideration of four issues—what, how, where, and when to teach. Concerning what to teach, successful teaching for thinking focuses on helping students develop a collection of component skills for a particular cognitive task rather than on improving the mind in general.
