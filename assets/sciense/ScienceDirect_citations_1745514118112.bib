Drawing upon case studies from new media education and the digital humanities, the paper argues that design thinking that is situated, interpretive, and user-oriented is well suited to these initiatives. The paper concludes with a call for design thinking research to engage with emerging models for learning and knowledge production, work whose effects could be felt at an epistemic level for generations.}

Therefore, “waste-to-energy” (WtE) techniques appear as a possible approach to convert solid residues into energy, within more energy-efficient processes to emit less or no CO2. Plasma gasification constitutes a proficient and clean alternative with multiple environmental gains, simultaneously reducing or eliminating toxicity and pollution issues while avoiding the landfilling of huge amounts of residues. To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living.}

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.}

Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.}

I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.}

Synthesizing recent developments in the fields of personality, political science, and psychopathology, we characterize individual variation in politics as high-dimensional, heterarchical, intrapersonally eclectic, and contextually shaped and activated. Developing a data-driven taxonomic model of political-psychological phenomena will help create a foundational base of knowledge within political psychology that is more rigorous, more replicable, and certainly richer to investigate.}

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.}

We discuss how this is inconsistent with data and modern evolutionary ‘tree thinking’. Phylogenetic comparative methods with broad sampling provide the best means to make rigorous inferences about ancestral traits and evolutionary transitions that occurred within each lineage, and to determine whether consistent phenotypic and genomic changes occurred across independent lineages.}

Online administration did not affect originality, but led to slightly fewer responses overall. This demonstrated that online administration of creative thinking is indeed feasible and reliable, though steps must be taken to ensure participants exhaust all possible responses. To test the effect of time limits on responses, 84 participants (Study 2) completed a verbal fluency task and three divergent thinking tasks online, half of the participants doing so under time pressure (3min). There were significant interactions between time limits and task content for both time-on-task and fluency variables, but the task type was the dominant force in the varying fluency and time-on-task scores. Originality was not significantly affected by time limits, but did vary across tasks. In all cases the results illustrate that assessment of divergent thinking, as a proxy of creative thinking, is feasible using online methods. Implications for future work in this area are discussed.}

This neglect is due, in part, to the limitations of the information processing paradigm that dominated cognitive psychology in its formative years. With the emergence of the embodiment approach to cognition, however, sport has become a dynamic natural laboratory in which to investigate the relationship between thinking and skilled action. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore some insights into the relationship between thinking and action that have emerged from recent research on exceptional performance states (e.g., ‘flow’ and ‘choking’) in athletes. The paper begins by explaining why cognitive psychologists’ traditional indifference to sport has been replaced by a more enthusiastic attitude in recent years. The next section provides some insights into the relationship between thinking and skilled action that have emerged from research on ‘flow’ (or peak performance) and ‘choking’ (or impaired performance) experiences in athletes. The third section of the paper explores some practical issues that arise when athletes seek to exert conscious control over their thoughts in competitive situations. The final part of the paper considers the implications of research on thinking in action in sport for practical attempts to improve thinking skills in domains such as business organizations and schools.}

Poets, for instance, are often noted for their mental health challenges and elevated suicide rates. This study investigates the link between creativity and suicide among modern and contemporary Chinese poets by employing computational techniques to analyze semantic creativity in their works. Examining 16 poets who died by suicide alongside 21 non-suicidal counterparts, we introduced a dual model that combines flow distance and co-occurrence networks to assess creative cognition. The findings indicate that suicidal poets exhibit significantly higher local and global flow distances, reflecting greater divergent thinking. Furthermore, their co-occurrence networks display more tightly interconnected and efficient structures, suggesting enhanced cognitive flexibility. By demonstrating that heightened creativity, characterized by distinct semantic network properties, is associated with mental health challenges, the study provides empirical support for the "mad genius" hypothesis. These results contribute to the understanding of the creativity-psychopathology nexus, offering novel insights and advancing computational methods for analyzing creative expression.}

In TCM theory, pathogenesis is a complex system composed of a group of interrelated factors, which is highly consistent with the character of systems science (SS). In this paper, we introduce a heuristic definition called pathogenesis network (PN) to represent pathogenesis in the form of the directed graph. Accordingly, a computational method of pathogenesis diagnosis, called network differentiation (ND), is proposed by integrating the holism principle in SS. ND consists of three stages. The first stage is to generate all possible diagnoses by Cartesian Product operated on specified prior knowledge corresponding to the input symptoms. The second stage is to screen the validated diagnoses by holism principle. The third stage is to pick out the clinical diagnosis by physician-computer interaction. Some theorems are stated and proved for the further optimization of ND in this paper. We conducted simulation experiments on 100 clinical cases. The experimental results show that our proposed method has an excellent capability to fit the holistic thinking in the process of physician inference.}

abstract = {Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and progressive type of brain disorder that affects parts of the brain responsible for memory, speaking, thinking, and many other important functions. Apart from its common risk factors such as aging, environment, and lifestyle elements, the risk of developing AD largely depends on gene variants, which present a promising opportunity for identifying novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.
Objectives
Early studies have revealed numerous SNPs simultaneously associated with AD and other diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and more. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on identifying single nucleotide missense mutations in certain genes specifically linked to AD to understand the prognosis and diagnosis of the disease.
Methods
In this research, we utilized multiple sequence-based computational tools and database servers to analyze specific missense single nucleotide polymorphisms and their potential effects on protein structure and stability.
Results
Our in-silico analysis revealed SNPs of 3 genes, specifically, ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2, to be deleterious. The associating mutations were found to be destabilizing the protein structure and function of deleterious genes.
Conclusion
Three genes, including ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2 and their associated SNPs, were found to be deleterious and are potentially linked to AD. Amino acid changes associated with these genes were found to affect their interactions, which are connected to specific biological processes and pathways that may trigger AD.}

abstract = {Patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) are at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), but this well-described and clinically important association is not well-understood. Prior research suggests that STBs often function as an attempt to escape aversive affect, and that people with BPD experience stronger emotion reactivity and greater discomfort with emotion than those without BPD. Here, we tested whether negative affective states are more likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with BPD than those without this disorder. Data on affective states and suicidal thoughts were collected several times per day from 35 psychiatric inpatients using their smartphones to capture real-time associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. Results revealed that the association between negative affective states (e.g., abandonment, desperation, guilt, hopelessness, loneliness, rage, self-hatred, and upset), and severity of suicidal thinking was stronger among those with BPD than among those without BPD. This finding has implications for risk assessment and intervention in the clinical setting: for a given degree of reported negative affect, patients with BPD experience more suicidal ideation than those without. Further research needs to be done to elucidate the mechanism of this effect.}

Five hundred eighty-two 6th graders were recruited from 12 public elementary schools located across Taiwan. Both ready-made and self-constructed instruments were used in this study. The major findings are shown as follows. The three analogy subscales in the multiple-choice form were all significantly correlated with analytical and creative thinking, with their correlations with analytical thinking stronger than those with creative thinking. In contrast, the analogy subscales in the non-multiple-choice form, the simile sentence completion, had a much stronger correlation with creative thinking than that with analytical thinking. The traditional analogical-verbal items in the multiple-choice form and the analogy test items in the form of simile sentence completion could significantly predict creative thinking independent of analytical thinking and also significantly predict analytical thinking independent of creative thinking. In addition, the simile sentence completion, openness to experience, and analytical thinking could significantly explain the variance of creative thinking. Discussions of the findings, with a special focus on the two types of novel analogy items, were presented in the context of the existing literature.}

Despite significant research advancements, the mechanisms underlying altered anticipation remain poorly understood, and effective targeted treatments are largely lacking. This review proposes an integrated computational psychiatry approach to address these challenges. We begin by outlining how altered anticipation presents across different psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and eating disorders, and summarizing the insights gained from extensive research using self-report scales and task-based neuroimaging, despite notable limitations. We then explore how emerging computational modeling approaches, such as reinforcement learning and anticipatory utility theory, could overcome these limitations and offer deeper insights into underlying mechanisms and individual variations. We propose that integrating these interdisciplinary methodologies can offer comprehensive transdiagnostic insights, aiding the discovery of new therapeutic targets and advancing precision psychiatry.}

In this regard, various planning approaches have been put forward by the scholarship as alternatives to the conventional model. The planning practice, however, is often following the path-dependent legacy of conventional approaches. This study puts forward a planning intervention, which can be plugged into conventional planning processes, as a way of building capacity for alternative planning approaches to take off. The intervention aims at enabling exploratory thinking within the planning process. Exploratory thinking considers alternative perspectives to planning issues, different from the well-established frames of reference, to potentially reveal some of the blind-spots in the business-as-usual planning. Trial application of the proposed intervention within the process of planning for development of a flood management strategy in Melbourne, Australia, provides propitious indications of widening the scope of thinking among the participants. Based on the achieved insights, a methodology for carrying out the proposed intervention is presented. The methodology would be relevant, and potentially useful, for both planning scholars and practitioners.}

Several studies had shown that there are different results in EEG patterns of males and females. Therefore, this study examined the EEG pattern changes of males and females during convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) in comparison to the rest condition.Methods: This study was a fundamental-theoretical research with quasi experimental design. 34 subjects (19 boys and 15 girls) were chosen according to available sampling method by using a screening questionnaire. Each of them assigned in three conditions (rest, CT and DT). In the CT and DT conditions subjects were solved the tasks that were related to these two kinds of thinking but during rest condition they didn’t solve any task. In all three conditions, EEG patterns were recorded from 19 scalp areas. The recorded EEG in theta band, were transformed into quantitative form (QEEG) by using neuroguide software and these quantities analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA method.Results: descriptive results of this study had showed that coherence of EEG patterns in convergent thinking and divergent thinking are higher than rest condition. But there was no significant difference between these two kinds of thinking. Also the results of repeated measure ANOVA had shown that these 3 conditions hadn’t significant differences in coherence patterns in two genders. Conclusion: The results probably are due to neglect the especial function of each hemispheres. Other probability that we can consider for these results is the thinking skills that basically have no biological difference. these results can provide a background for future studies about cognitive functions.}

abstract = {Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest.

The study has been conducted with 300 students studying in the 7th and 8th grades in two private schools in Cankaya, Ankara. In the study “Reflective Thinking Skills towards Problem Solving Scale” (Kızılkaya & Askar, 2009) and “Mathematics Attitude Scale” (Onal, 2013) have been used. In order to determine the levels of students in terms of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation values of the scores obtained via the scales have been calculated and to find out if there is a significant difference between these scores regarding gender, MANOVA has been used. Whether there is a significant difference between the scores of male and female students has been tested by using the scores the students got in total and in the sub-dimensions of the scales. It is found that there does not exist a significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their gender. However, there is a significant difference in favor of the male students in terms of their attitudes towards mathematics. There is a moderate significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics in the positive sense.}

abstract = {The emphasis of using computing tools in scientific practice has called for new forms of scientific modeling. Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to computational scientific modeling in which students use the computational power of computers to model and learn about science phenomena. However, computational scientific modeling is challenging since it involves not only scientific concepts but also uses computational representations to model the science concepts. This study hypothesizes that prompting students to self-explain critical subgoals of computational scientific modeling before taking part in the construction of models would help them construct correct computational models. This study recruited 65 10th grade students in a 6-week program. They were randomly assigned to a self-explanation group (n = 29) where students learned with the self-explanation for subgoals of computational scientific modeling, and a demonstration group (n = 36) where the teacher directly demonstrated the modeling process before students took part in the modeling activity. This study collected the students' performance in a paper-based and hands-on modeling test, and also their modeling actions in the hands-on test to understand the impact of the self-explanation scaffolding on their computational scientific modeling. The results showed that the two groups demonstrated similar levels of improvements in the paper-based test, suggesting that both types of scaffolding are helpful for computational scientific modeling learning. However, the self-explanation group demonstrated significantly better modeling quality in the hands-on test. Furthermore, the spotlight analysis found the moderation effect of the modeling actions on the relation between the two treatments and the model quality. The self-explanation group constructed high quality models if they took only a low number of modeling actions. Conversely, frequent modeling actions are necessary for the demonstration group to construct quality scientific models. The results suggest that the self-explanation scaffolding is more effective since students did not simply rely on the trial-and-error strategy, but adopted a strategic approach to constructing scientific models.}

abstract = {Introduction
Desire Thinking (DT) is a voluntary cognitive process aimed at orienting to prefigure images, information, and memories about positive target-related experience. It comprises of two components: Imaginal Prefiguration and the Verbal Perseveration. DT has been found to be positively associated with alcohol use, gambling, nicotine use, and problematic Internet use. Despite this, neither qualitative nor quantitative reviews have been undertaken to critically summarize findings about the association between DT and addictive behaviours. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the strength of the association between DT and addictive behaviours.
Method
In accordance to PRISMA criteria, a research was conducted on PubMed and PsycInfo. A manual search of reference lists was also run. Search terms were: “addiction / gambling / alcohol / tobacco / nicotine / drug / cocaine / marijuana / cannabis / opioid / heroin / methadone / internet” AND “Desire Thinking”.
Results
Ten studies were included. Both components of DT were found to be associated with addictive behaviours (alcohol use, nicotine use, gambling, problematic Internet use) in both clinical and community samples. The strength of the association between Verbal Perseveration and addictive behaviours appears to be stronger for alcohol and nicotine use than Internet use. The association between DT and addictive behaviours is not moderated by age.
Conclusion
DT is present across different addictive behaviours. The assessment of DT and tailored interventions aimed to reduce the propensity to engage in DT should be considered in the treatment of addictive behaviours.}

This phenomenon was studied in an experiment where participants made multidimensional visual choices. It was found that the effect of this shift on decision-making performance was dependent on the quality of the explanations during introspection, while the performance in silent conditions was not.

abstract = {Children’s multiplicative thinking as the visualization of equal group structures and the enumeration the composite units was the subject of this study. The results were obtained from a small sample of Australian children (n = 18) in their first year of school (mean age 5 years 6 months) who participated in a lesson taught by their classroom teacher. The 12 Little Ducks problem stimulated children to visualize and to draw different ways of making equal groups. Fifteen children (83 %) could identify and create equal groups; eight of these children (44 %) could also quantify the number of groups they formed. These findings show that some young children understand early multiplicative ideas and can visualize equal group situations and communicate about these through their drawings and talk. The study emphasises the value of encouraging mathematical visualization from an early age; using open thought-provoking problems to reveal children’s thinking; and promoting drawing as a form of mathematical communication.}

Moderator analyses using an expanded set of 96 effect sizes indicated that upward counterfactuals and regret produced significant positive effects that were similar in strength. Effects also did not vary as a function of the theme of the counterfactual-inducing situation or study design (cross-sectional versus longitudinal). Significant effect size heterogeneity was observed across sample types, methods of assessing upward counterfactual thinking, and types of depression scale. Significant positive effects were found in studies that employed samples of bereaved individuals, older adults, terminally ill patients, or university students, but not adolescent mothers or mixed samples. Both number-based and Likert-based upward counterfactual thinking assessments produced significant positive effects, with the latter generating a larger effect. All depression scales produced significant positive effects, except for the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview. Research and theoretical implications are discussed in relation to cognitive theories of depression and the functional theory of upward counterfactual thinking, and important gaps in the extant research literature are identified.}

abstract = {A surprising finding from U.S. opinion surveys is that political disagreements tend to be greatest among the most cognitively sophisticated opposing partisans. Recent experiments suggest a hypothesis that could explain this pattern: cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing of new information. However, the designs of these experiments tend to contain several limitations that complicate their support for this hypothesis. In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.}

These abilities and tendencies are indicators of cognitive sophistication and the development of these indicators serve as foundations for successful performance on these tasks. Cognitive abilities, such as intelligence and executive function task performance are measurable early in development and display considerable growth over the course of development. Thinking dispositions include tendencies or styles toward information processing, and the study of these tendencies in development has also been examined in the temperament and metacognitive literature. Cognitive abilities and thinking dispositions support the processing demands of judgment and decision-making tasks, including resistance to miserly information processing. Specific types of knowledge that support judgment and decision-making performance also emerge early in development, including probabilistic numeracy. Knowledge can also inhibit performance, such as endorsement of superstitious thinking. These foundations are all measurable in developmental samples and have also been shown to be correlated with judgment and decision-making performance in child and youth samples.}

This paper presents an original semi-dynamic modelling framework that simultaneously considers i) ES supply and demand dynamics, ii) negative environmental impacts, externalities, and financial costs derived from NBS, and iii) life cycle NBS impacts beyond the use phase. Compared to other models, it also aims to be valuable for urban planning actions at site level, i.e., for evaluating the net impacts of specific urban NBS projects. To validate the modelling framework, a proof-of-concept model for urban forests is developed and tested for a case study in Madrid (Spain). The modelling framework is split in two interrelated parts: foreground (dynamic modelling) and background (static modelling). In the foreground, the environmental impacts derived from the use phase of an NBS project are quantified considering its spatio-temporal dynamism, by making use of system dynamics. In the background, the environmental impacts derived from the rest of the life cycle phases of the NBS are quantified making use of steady state life cycle impact assessment. The net economic impact of the NBS project, considering both financial values and externalities, is eventually calculated in the background encompassing all the life cycle phases. Results from the case study illustrate how planning, design, and management decisions over the entire life cycle of an urban forest can influence the net environmental and economic performance of this type of NBS. A discussion is provided to inform on how the modelling framework can help moving beyond the state-of-the-art, and how the derived model can be used for sustainability assessments of urban NBS projects.}

Our meta-analysis clarifies this issue by synthesizing the effects of programming interventions for 3- to 7-year-old children. Moreover, we propose and employ a taxonomy for instructional approaches commonly used in programming interventions to systematically analyze the relevance of instructional design. The results from 25 early childhood studies and 82 effect sizes showed a medium overall effect of d = +0.73, 95 % CI [0.51, 0.96]. Programming interventions effectively enhanced programming knowledge, computational thinking, mathematics knowledge, and cognitive skills. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of unplugged over screen-based activities and interventions, including robotics, over those using other program outputs. The results provide educators with valuable information about instructional methods. The taxonomy can guide researchers and educators in implementing instructional strategies when teaching programming.
Educational relevance statement
The current meta-analysis extends the current understanding of programming interventions by summarizing the existing body of literature on the effectiveness of programming interventions in young children. Since there exists a growing interest in teaching programming to young children, the results make a useful contribution to determine its effectiveness and to identify effective instructional characteristics. The found results indicate that programming interventions are indeed significantly effective in early childhood to enhance a variety of outcomes. Further, the analyses provide information that allow educators to implement age-appropriate programming interventions in educational settings (e.g., by using unplugged programming activities or including robotics).}

The objective of this paper is to develop a community-centered approach by integrating rapid and participatory nature of design thinking with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to support sustainable development. While design thinking engages multiple stakeholders for generating alternatives, MCDA provides metrics for assessing these alternatives. Drawing on an example from a small scale mining development in Central America, this paper shows that early community involvement and rigorous impact assessment on a regular basis motivate community involvement and give value to the social outcome of mining development.}

Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field. Finally, a 1:1:1 -model for realising research-based suggestions in PD programmes is presented.}

The studies were categorised according to the type of outcome measured or analysed: (1) rates and severity of crashes; (2) unsafe and non-compliant road user behaviours; and (3) road user risk perception, attitudes and beliefs. Most studies focused on unsafe and/or non-compliant road user behaviour. The factors identified within the studies as influencing risk at RLXs were classified using the Accident Mapping (AcciMap) technique, a systems analysis framework. AcciMap maps the factors that influence behaviour across six system levels ranging from Government to the operating environment. Most of the factors identified within the studies related to physical attributes of the crossing itself, its operation, and the behaviours and attributes of road users. Comparatively fewer systemic factors were identified (i.e. policy and budgeting). Few relationships between factors were identified, indicating that little consideration has been given interactions between factors (i.e. how crossing design influences end-user decision making). A research agenda is proposed based on systems thinking and the use of a ‘many model’ approach to understand and address risk at RLXs.}

abstract = {Individuals who experience recurrent negative thoughts are at elevated risk for mood and anxiety disorders. It is thus essential to understand why some individuals get stuck in recurrent negative thinking (RNT), whereas others are able to disengage eventually. Theoretical models propose that individuals high in recurrent negative thinking suffer from deficits in controlling the contents of working memory. Empirical findings, however, are inconclusive. In this meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 94 studies to examine the proposed association between RNT and deficits in cognitive control. We included numerous effect sizes not reported in the primary publications. Moderator analyses tested the influence of variables, such as stimuli valence, cognitive control function (e.g., shifting, discarding), or type of RNT (i.e., rumination or worry). Results demonstrated an association between repetitive negative thinking and deficits in only one specific cognitive control function, namely difficulty discarding no longer relevant material from working memory (r = −0.20). This association remained significant after controlling for level of psychopathology. There was no substantial association between RNT and deficits in any other cognitive control function. All other moderators were not significant. We discuss limitations (e.g., primary sample sizes, reliability of paradigms) and highlight implications for future research and clinical interventions.}

We frame Smartphone use as an instantiation of the extended mind—the notion that our cognition goes beyond our brains—and in so doing, characterize a modern form of cognitive miserliness. Specifically, that people typically forego effortful analytic thinking in lieu of fast and easy intuition suggests that individuals may allow their Smartphones to do their thinking for them. Our account predicts that individuals who are relatively less willing and/or able to engage effortful reasoning processes may compensate by relying on the internet through their Smartphones. Across three studies, we find that those who think more intuitively and less analytically when given reasoning problems were more likely to rely on their Smartphones (i.e., extended mind) for information in their everyday lives. There was no such association with the amount of time using the Smartphone for social media and entertainment purposes, nor did boredom proneness qualify any of our results. These findings demonstrate that people may offload thinking to technology, which in turn demands that psychological science understand the meshing of mind and media to adequately characterize human experience and cognition in the modern era.}

Future smart cities will be characterized by their high distribution, openness, heterogeneity, complexity, unpredictable/uncertain/dynamic work environments, and their large-scale nature. These challenging characteristics require a transition from the traditional parts thinking paradigm which studies systems by breaking them down into their separate elements to the emerging systems thinking paradigm which represents a holistic approach focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems. In this article, we first study smart cities from systems thinking perspective and then introduce self-regulating agent systems and fog computing as promising technological paradigms for developing future large-scale complex smart cities applications. Preliminary simulation results to test the performance of the proposed framework are provided. The results show that self-regulated agent systems can give high performance if an appropriate self-regulation model is used. A complete architecture for building future complex smart cities based on the systems thinking paradigm and using self-regulating MAS integrated with fog computing for implementation is currently under preparation.}

In Study 1, we find that systems thinkers tend to believe in scientific consensus, recognize risks posed by climate change, and support policy interventions to address climate change; systems thinking was negatively related to conspiracist and free-market ideation. In Studies 2 and 3 we find that systems thinkers ascribe more value to the natural world — both in monetary terms as well as on social and ecological grounds. The findings suggest that models of environmental cognition can be improved by measuring peoples' tendency to engage in systems thinking.}

Results indicate that emphasizing the use of professional judgment is not sufficient to decrease auditors' mechanistic mentality. As expected, however, auditors primed to take a systems-thinking perspective are better able to evaluate the complexity of the situation and to more effectively apply professional judgment. These results suggest that the goal of improving professional judgment can be achieved with an underlying change to the way auditors think.}

In this course the students were exposed to basic systems concepts with a focus on system dynamics modeling (using Donella Meadows’ Thinking in Systems) of a permaculture-based food production system. They were given a basic problem: How much land area would be needed to collect enough solar energy in food plant photosynthesis per year to feed a community of fifty vegetarians? They were told that the farm would be in the Seattle WA, USA area so they could find the average monthly insolation values. Several additional rate constants and conversion factors were provided so they could build a spreadsheet-based model to generate the number of calories needed. This paper provides anecdotal evidence that systems theory naïve students were able to successfully build a model (in teams) but also were able to apply systems thinking to aspects of their own lives as demonstrated in essays (individuals). Many students reported “seeing the world differently” as a result of the course, particularly seeing how different aspects of the world are connected through various relations. As a result of these successes the course was upgraded to be a little more advanced for upper division students.2Problem-Project-based Learning - PPBL, a pedagogy for active learning.}

This article casts divergent thinking responding in the context of theories of memory search. First, it was argued that divergent thinking tasks are similar to semantic fluency tasks, but are more constrained, and less well structured. Next, response time distributions from 54 participants were analyzed for temporal and semantic clustering. Participants responded to two prompts from the alternative uses test: uses for a brick and uses for a bottle, for two minutes each. Participants’ cumulative response curves were negatively accelerating, in line with theories of search of associative memory. However, results of analyses of semantic and temporal clustering suggested that clustering is less evident in alternative uses responding compared to semantic fluency tasks. This suggests either that divergent thinking responding does not involve an exhaustive search through a clustered memory trace, but rather that the process is more exploratory, yielding fewer overall responses that tend to drift away from close associates of the divergent thinking prompt.}

The solution of this task suggests modelling the information exchange between active objects. Modelling is supposed to be carried out within the framework of the basic applicative computing system, in which the code fragments can be modelled by applicative objects. An important part of the task is to check the correctness of the scenarios composition, which requires the tools make compositional thinking about data flows, both when they are processed by scripts and contain them. The correctness is proposed to be provided by supporting the fairly strong typing system that excludes incorrect combinations of scenarios. The type system is assumed to be immersed into the applicative environment. The system is proposed to be built on the basis of the homotopy type theory, which ensures, in particular, the introduction of independent and dependent types, as well as the definition of recursion and induction principles for them. Partial approbation of typing constructions is performed with the example of the problem of semantic support for the implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).}

We demonstrate this approach by using a computational model of panic disorder to conduct an in silico dismantling study of cognitive behavioral therapy. This simulated trial allows us to: identify a common source of treatment failure; propose a revised treatment protocol that mitigates this source of failure; and demonstrate that, if the model is accurate, this revised protocol will lead to improved treatment outcomes for 10% of patients. We conclude with a discussion of the promise and challenges of using computational models for treatment research.}

A stronger growth theory predicted that participants spontaneously noticed more stimuli from the area outside their interests (Studies 2 and 3) and generated better integrative ideas (Study 1). Furthermore, they were more likely to generate ideas that bridged the arts and sciences (Study 2), which was also found after inducing fixed or growth theories, establishing causality (Study 3). Finally,perceived utility of the outside area mediated this relation (Study 4).

This study examines the gender divide in CIL and CT among adolescents in four European countries, highlighting the gender-based disparities in digital literacy development. Based on ICILS 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in CIL and CT using regression and decomposition methods. Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT. These findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy. This study offers insights for policymakers and educators to address the gender divide in digital literacy.}

In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution. The model was then explained through its application in a healthcare project—the SMARTAGE.

abstract = {A pedagogical framework for design learning and design teaching termed Think-Maps is introduced, presented and demonstrated. In this framework, domain knowledge becomes explicit as a significant component to be taught and transferred in design education. The Think-Maps framework proposes that by constructing a conceptual map that reflects one’s thinking in a domain, we make explicit the knowledge learned. The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking. Web-Pad — a computational tool that implements these ideas is presented and illustrated. Web-Pad is used for organizing and representing conceptual maps of a specific domain. The Think-Maps framework and the Web-Pad tool are demonstrated in an educational environment.}

It is an article that will open an entering wedge through which one will be able to bring himself up to speed on quantum computation and challenges/limitations thereof. We are indeed in luck to be living in an age where computing is being reinvented, and not only seeing history in the making firsthand but, in fact, having the opportunity to be the ones who are reinventing—and that is quite a thought.}

Business organizations, more than ever, recognize that they need employees who think creatively to maintain their competitive edge. Nonetheless, there is a lack of research assessing new ideas and influential factors in generating innovative ideas. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence the creation of innovative ideas. We conducted two different types of workshops with 22 subjects and 23 subjects each. In the first workshop, subjects were asked to generate new business ideas through analogical thinking. As a result, half of the participants generated appropriate ideas, and three influential factors were determined: categorization skill, deliberation, and trial and error. The second workshop was designed to facilitate participants to enhance these three factors. As a result, 70% of the participants could generate appropriate ideas. By identifying influential factors, this paper suggests a procedure for designing an innovation workshop that enables the creation of appropriate ideas.}

Measures of these variables were administrated to both university young adults (N = 232, study 1, a self-report scale was used for assessing academic performance) and primary school children (N = 158, study 2). Both studies showed that CT indicated by skills and dispositions made unique contributions to academic performance even when general cognitive ability was controlled for. Further, it was mainly CT dispositions that uniquely contributed to academic performance while the contribution of CT skills to academic performance largely overlapped with general cognitive ability. Our findings provide a first step toward understanding CT as a distinct construct from general cognitive ability in relation to learning and academic performance.}

Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the associations among inter-individual verbal creative thinking and both regional homogeneity and cortical morphology of the brain surface. We related the local functional homogeneity of spontaneous brain activity to verbal creative thinking and its dimensions—fluency, originality, and flexibility—by examining these inter-individual differences in a large sample of 268 healthy college students. Results revealed that people with high verbal creative ability and high scores for the three dimensions of creativity exhibited lower regional functional homogeneity in the right precuneus. Both cortical volume and thickness of the right precuneus were positively associated with individual verbal creativity and its dimensions. Moreover, originality was negatively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior frontal gyrus and positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the right occipito-temporal gyrus. In contrast, flexibility was positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior and middle occipital gyrus. These findings provide additional evidence of a link between verbal creative thinking and brain structure in the right precuneus—a region involved in internally-focused attention and effective semantic retrieval—and further suggest that local functional homogeneity of verbal creative thinking has neurobiological relevance that is likely based on anatomical substrates.}

We argue that looking at co-speech gestures might broaden the scope and shed new light on different thinking-for-speaking patterns. Data comes from a corpus study investigating the relationship between speech and gesture in two typologically different languages: Danish, a satellite-framed language and Italian, a verb-framed language. Results show cross-linguistic variation in how motion components are mapped onto linguistic constituents, but also show how Italian speakers to some degree deviate from standard verb-framed lexicalization patterns, and use typical satellite-framed constructions. Co-speech gestures, when they occur, largely follow the patterns used in speech, with a notable exception: In 28% of the cases, in fact, Italian speakers express manner in path-only speech constructions gesturally. This finding suggests that gestures may be instrumental in revealing what semantic components speakers attend to while speaking; in other words, purely verbal data may not fully account for the thinking part of the thinking-for-speaking hypothesis.}

Importantly, the issue of stimulus equivalence in developmental samples is much less of a problem in studies that use multiple indicators of cognitive sophistication, not just age differences. These multiple indicators can be used as converging evidence in triangulating developmental trends on rational thinking tasks. Age differences were obtained in childhood and early adolescence in the longitudinal developmental study, but not later in adolescence on all performance-based measures, including cognitive abilities and rational thinking tasks. Resistance to miserly information processing tasks can be used as an additional indicator of cognitive sophistication to correlate with response patterns on rational thinking tasks in developmental samples. Although such tasks do measure other aspects of process and knowledge (cognitive ability and numeracy), they also tap in part the participant’s ability to detect conflicts between normatively correct responses and rapidly emitted Type 1 processing. Task factors, particularly the process and knowledge demands of each rational thinking task, also contribute to explaining developmental patterns on these tasks. Identifying sources of cognitive failures on rational thinking tasks in children and youth can be mapped onto real-world correlates and provide new directions for training of these skills and abilities.}

The results showed that gene co-expression network modules in anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, amygdala and substantia nigra were enriched with DT association signals. Further functional enrichment analysis showed that these DT-related gene co-expression network modules were enriched for key biological process and cellular component related to myelination, suggesting that cortical and sub-cortical grey matter myelination may serve as important neurobiological basis of DT. Although the underlying mechanisms need to be further refined, this exploratory study may provide new insight into the neurobiology of DT.}

The chapter begins with considering the emerging high-level consensus descriptions of the future system model with its structural pillars (data, well-being, and integration) and features (AI, ambient, and collaborative). It then “fleshes” out the details of this form through the system's function, expressed as resilient integration driving health ecosystem operations: Data+well-being=Efficiency+equity. The chapter then seeks to demonstrate how the major structural elements of the future's health ecosystem (precision medicine, public health, telehealth, and safety) and their societal contextual elements (political economics and ethics) can be optimally arranged as “complementary ecosystem base pairs” in the system DNA above, with their double-helix “backbone” being the reality of each patient as a person in community with other persons, understood from a consensus-based pluralistic standpoint. It then seeks to illustrate this final conceptual framework in practical emerging cases including AI-powered well-being (in its global, strategic, and structural aspects), maturing enterprise-wide AI-powered healthcare (in its local, operational, and functional aspects), and emerging transformation trends (including dignity-security moral interoperability, strategic empathy, adaptive empowerment networks, embedded clinical trials, digital twins, quantum health, and liquid AI in cloud electronic health records). The chapter concludes by proposing how modern value-based healthcare systems can transform through efficient and ethical AI to become the future's thinking healthcare system operating as optimized health ecosystems in the global digital ecosystem that is self-aware, self-adaptive, and other-serving, with artificial intelligence integrated with human compassion, worthy of the patients it serves.}

abstract = {Geopolitical forecasting tournaments have stimulated the development of methods for improving probability judgments of real-world events. But these innovations have focused on easier-to-quantify variables, like personnel selection, training, teaming, and crowd aggregation—bypassing messier constructs, like qualitative properties of forecasters’ rationales. Here, we adapt methods from natural language processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to identify distinctive reasoning strategies in the rationales of top forecasters, including: (a) cognitive styles, such as dialectical complexity, that gauge tolerance of clashing perspectives and efforts to blend them into coherent conclusions and (b) the use of comparison classes or base rates to inform forecasts. In addition to these core metrics, we explore metrics derived from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Applying these tools to multiple tournaments and to forecasters of widely varying skill (from Mechanical Turkers to carefully culled “superforecasters”) revealed that: (a) top forecasters show higher dialectical complexity in their rationales and use more comparison classes; (b) experimental interventions, like training and teaming, that boost accuracy also influence NLP profiles of rationales, nudging them in a “superforecaster” direction.}

abstract = {The energy sector has suffered a significant restructuring that has increased the complexity in electricity market players' interactions. The complexity that these changes brought requires the creation of decision support tools to facilitate the study and understanding of these markets. The Multiagent Simulator of Competitive Electricity Markets (MASCEM) arose in this context, providing a simulation framework for deregulated electricity markets. The Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System (ALBidS) is a multiagent system created to provide decision support to market negotiating players. Fully integrated with MASCEM, ALBidS considers several different strategic methodologies based on highly distinct approaches. Six Thinking Hats (STH) is a powerful technique used to look at decisions from different perspectives, forcing the thinker to move outside its usual way of thinking. This paper aims to complement the ALBidS strategies by combining them and taking advantage of their different perspectives through the use of the STH group decision technique. The combination of ALBidS' strategies is performed through the application of a genetic algorithm, resulting in an evolutionary learning approach.}

abstract = {Charles S. Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science, which leads to the info-computational view of nature, mind and culture. However, this theory lacks a phenomenological foundation. David Chalmers' double aspect interpretation of information attempts to overcome the limitations of the info-computational view. Chalmers supplements Batesonian and Wheelerian info-computationalism – both of which lack a phenomenological aspect - with a dimension that corresponds to the phenomenological aspect of reality. However, he does not manage to produce an integrated theory of the development of meaning and rationality. Alex Hankey's further work goes some way towards establishing a theory that can satisfy Husserl's criteria for consciousness - such as a sense of being and time - but Hankey's dependence on Chalmers' theory is still not able to account for what the connection between core consciousness and the physical world is.}

abstract = {People often seek new information and eagerly update their beliefs. Other times they avoid information or resist revising their beliefs. What explains those different reactions? Answers to this question often frame information processing as a competition between cognition and motivation. Here, we dissolve this dichotomy by bringing together two theoretical frameworks: epistemic motivation and active inference. Despite evolving from different intellectual traditions, both frameworks attest to the indispensability of motivational considerations to the epistemic process. The imperatives that guide model construction under the epistemic motivation framework can be mapped onto key constructs in active inference. Drawing these connections offers a way of articulating social psychological constructs in terms of Bayesian computations and provides a generative testing ground for future work.}

In this study we report on an investigation into the nature of creative thinking in online dialogues and whether or not this creative thinking can be coded for and recognized automatically such that moderators can be alerted when creative thinking is occurring or when it has not occurred after a period of time. We outline a dialogic theory of creativity, as the emergence of new perspectives from the interplay of voices, and the testing of this theory using a range of methods including a coding scheme which combined coding for creative thinking with more established codes for critical thinking, artificial intelligence pattern-matching techniques to see if our codes could be read automatically from maps and ‘key event recall’ interviews to explore the experience of participants. Our findings are that: (1) the emergence of new perspectives in a graphical dialogue map can be recognized by our coding scheme supported by a machine pattern-matching algorithm in a way that can be used to provide awareness indicators for moderators; (2) that the trigger events leading to the emergence of new perspectives in the online dialogues studied were most commonly disagreements and (3) the spatial representation of messages in a graphically mediated synchronous dialogue environment such as Digalo may offer more affordance for creativity than the much more common scrolling text chat environments. All these findings support the usefulness of our new account of creativity in online dialogues based on dialogic theory and demonstrate that this account can be operationalised through machine coding in a way that can be turned into alerts for moderators.}

It has been widely recognised that engineering design encompasses two ways of thinking—creative and critical. A central argument that the synergy of creativity and criticality is significantly enhanced by connecting true interdisciplinary augmentation with the fine arts is discussed along with reflecting on the importance of such an approach in higher education.}
