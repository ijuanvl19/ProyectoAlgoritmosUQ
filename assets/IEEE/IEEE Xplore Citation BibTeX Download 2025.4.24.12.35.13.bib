  abstract={Adaptive online learning can facilitate students' support by responding immediately to the user's interactions. Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support.},

  abstract={This work presents the results of a research that aimed to evaluate the use of the Scratch visual programming language in the development of computational thinking, in comparison with the use of pseudocode, during the teaching of logic and programming algorithms. The research was delineated with a methodology of action research, which made possible the evaluation of the Scratch language and the pseudocode at the end of the approach of each content. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate that the use of the Scratch language presented better results during the initial stages; as the complexity of the content increased, the use of the pseudocode produced better results. Nevertheless, it is worth noting the good acceptance of the Scratch language for the teaching-learning process of the contents, as well as the contribution that it has had to the learning of logic and programming algorithms.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems.},

  pages={34-44 vol.2},
  abstract={A cellular automaton (CA) recently developed by D.H. Rothman and J.M. Keller (1988) simulates the flow of two incompressible, immiscible, viscous fluids in two dimensions. This automaton has been simulated on the CM-2 Connection Machine using a sequence of logical operations and table lookups to determine the state of a CA site from its old state and those of its neighbors. The logical operations are performed in parallel by each of the Connection Machine processors, while the table lookups use the indirect addressing capabilities among groups of 32 processors. A description is given of CA fluids, including the issue of isotropy, the choice of a rule set, and the averaging procedure used to obtain hydrodynamical quantities. The CM-2 Connection Machine is then described, with emphasis on the indirect addressing capabilities of the machine. A complete description is also given of the Rothman-Keller model for two-phase flow. It is shown how the indirect addressing is used in the simulation algorithm, and how a symmetry in the dynamics is used to reduce the size of the lookup tables by a factor of six. A time sequence of results showing the separation of two immiscible phases from an initially homogenized state is presented.<>},

  abstract={Representing human knowledge plays an important role in artificial intelligence science. Nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing knowledge such as semantic networks, conceptual graphs, computational networks. Computational Objects Knowledge Base (COKB) can be used to represent knowledge in many kinds of knowledge domain, such as Linear Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Direct Current Electrical Circuits. However, COKB model cannot be used to represent knowledge and solve problems about chemical elements efficiently. In this paper, we propose a variation of COKB model called Che-COKB which is the useful tool to represent knowledge about chemical elements and solve some kinds of problems in this knowledge domain. Furthermore, the algorithms for solving problems on model have been built up. In addition, the proposed model and algorithms were also applied to construct an application for solving some problems about chemical elements on mobile devices.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={One important pedagogical approach is to motivate students actively learn and discover new knowledge by using contemporary instructional design methods. This is in sharp contrast to another approach that forces students to take a passive rote-learning strategy. To promote active learning, CityU Hong Kong adopted the so-called discovery-enriched curriculum (DEC) pedagogical approach to enhance student learning at the tertiary education setting. While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work. According to our best knowledge, this is one of the few successful research work of applying a topic modeling method to enhance the assessment of students' achievements under a DEC pedagogical approach. The practical application and implications of our work is that educational practitioners can apply the proposed computational method to facilitate the assessment of students' novel discoveries.},

  abstract={In view of the relatively backward situation of automation information technology in manufacturing enterprises, this paper analyzes the manufacturing process of industry, designs and constructs a HD_MAS (Hierarchical Distributed Multi-Agent Systems(MAS)) architecture for collaborative control of process industry process so as to achieve collaborative control optimization for the whole manufacturing process. Based on MAS technology, this paper constructs a collaborative control model for manufacturing system that integrates multiple production units. This model combines several intelligent modules and physical entities organically. Based on the cooperation between Multi-agents, the improved MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm is proposed. A new algorithm framework called DS_MADDPG (Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) is applied to this model. Through the cooperation of Multi-agents, a certain intelligent control system is formed so that it can accurately complete complex production tasks and achieve distributed collaborative control of the manufacturing process, which will drive manufacturing companies to transform into the smart manufacturing.},

  abstract={Involvement has become an important variable in consumer behavior and marketing research for a long time. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can explain the complicated relationship between antecedents, consequences, and different types of involvement at the same time to understand the internal state of consumers better. Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.},

  abstract={In an increasingly tech-based world, the integration of programming education at a global scale plays a crucial role in equipping students for the future. Programming languages such as Scratch, Alice, and Blockly have been available for some time and have effectively used visual and intuitive interfaces in introducing beginners to basic concepts in coding. However, with the emergence of Large Language Models like GPT-4, the vision of programming education is to evolve into real-time, contextual support and personalized feedback that makes them understand even better, improves problem-solving skills, and increases engagement. The synergy between blocks and LLMs facilitates an accessible, interactive, and highly supportive environment for learning among children. In this paper, we critically analyze block-based programming and LLMs to determine which offers a more advanced and impactful approach to the programming education of children. This review illustrates how these technologies supplement and compete with each other, shaping the future landscape of programming education by equipping the next generation with critical technological skills. We highlight the ethical concerns that might arise for LLMs. We point out how LLMs may adopt several strategies to address and counter such ethical challenges.},

They have no use for end user tools for dummies. They question the cost and complexity of accepted software engineering and IT approaches. Lacking better alternatives they often resort to hodge-podge collections of scripts and arcane tools. Thinkers need a capability to Think-Compute-See and to actively participate in problem solutions.},

  abstract={It is shown that the fundamental basis and the primary basis for the concepts in the field of algorithmization of modern intelligent systems lie in the philosophical knowledge of the world and the process of thinking as such. It is indicated that the creation of modern artificial intelligent systems is based primarily on the knowledge of the actual thinking of the person, his ability to create different ways, mechanisms, tools of intellectual activity. It is emphasized that algorithms are practically the first among them and have now become one of the main ways of building intelligent systems. It is stated that the theory of algorithms itself, as one of the basic and fundamental branches of mathematics, transforming in its time from philosophy, is based on studies of epistemology, the subject of which is the process of human knowledge as such, in its entirety. It is presented from the position of epistemology and ontology as fundamental sections for the philosophy that the creation of modern integrated modules of information technology systems is unthinkable without taking into account the complex of relationships, interactions in the system "man-machine", and algorithms are the leading way to develop any artificial systems, including intelligent systems. Science is an important area of human activity, always aimed at the development and systematization of objective knowledge about the real world.},

  abstract={Distributed computing is becoming a prime need of the current era. The users are demanding more from the existing computing systems in terms of the computational power. The inherent nature of distributed computing enables the distribution of computationally expensive work across various available resources. Due to the distribution of the resources across multiple locations, there exists the challenge of discovering, synthesizing, and facilitating the resources to the client requests. In addition, the discovered resources must also comply with user requests to the diversely available resources along with their current information. In this paper, we aim to explore the resource discovery domain in the area of distributed computing and study the recent proposed schemes. We provide a survey of the distributed networking architecture and inherent discovery techniques. Furthermore, a critical analysis and comparison of the studied approaches is provided considering their networking architecture and the discovery technique.},

  abstract={Despite the enthusiasm and initiatives for making programming accessible to students outside Computer Science (CS), unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions about how we should be teaching programming to engineers, scientists, artists or other non-CS majors. We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

  title={A Methodology Proposal Based on Metaphors to Teach Programming to Children}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={13},
  number={1},
  pages={46-53},
  abstract={Interest in studying computer science has been extended to children. However, it is unclear which educational method should be used. Teachers need help to tackle this task. Therefore, this paper proposes using metaphors, such as recipe/program (and sequence), pantry/memory, and boxes/variables. It also illustrates the possibility of applying these metaphors to any resource available to the teacher. Four step-by-step scripts of how to use the metaphors in class are provided, with the opinions of sixty-two children (enrolled in grades fourth, fifth, and sixth of Spanish Primary Education, 9 to 11 years in age) and their teacher's opinion.},

  year={2020},

  abstract={The abstract nature of programming makes learning to code a daunting undertaking for many novice learners. In this work, we advocate the use of comics—a medium capable of presenting abstract ideas in a concrete, familiar way—for introducing programming concepts. Particularly, we propose a design process and related tools to help students and teachers create coding strips, a form of comic strips that are associated with a piece of code. We conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. We find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts.},

  title={Collaboration and Gender Equity in Game-Based Learning for Middle School Computer Science}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={18},
  number={2},
  pages={18-28},
  abstract={Game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and have a significant capacity to engage students. Yet, they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior game experience. This article presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can effectively address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, the authors first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at supporting all students during computer science learning. In early phases of the intervention, male students outpaced female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multiweek classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that gender differences could dissipate over time within collaborative game-based learning experiences in computer science.},
