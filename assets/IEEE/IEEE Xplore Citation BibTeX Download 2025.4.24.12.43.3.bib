  abstract={Educational institutions and education system play the important role in any society or country for development in all aspects like agriculture, industrial, economic and political. Teaching methodologies, learning preferences and techniques, socio-economics decide the student learning capabilities. Cognitive Learning (CL) is a kind of learning that is constructive, active, durable, and productive. It employs educates in the learning measures, encouraging them to think effectively to make connections when learning new things. In this paper, we want to demonstrate the student learning capabilities using their cognitive abilities. For this, we demeanor training and examines on different cognitive abilities and also collect the personal and other factors which impact student learning. In this process, we conduct training and examine the 313 engineering educates from AITAM Eng. College, A.P., India. We apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for feature selection, and for prediction, use the ANN with back-propagation algorithm. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is constructed, as that the hidden layer of ANN neurons initially is two, after that we increment the neurons by one until reach good accurate results. The 5-neurons HL ANN is performed well as per performance parameters like accuracy (100%), AUC (1), R-value (1), recall, and precisions values.},

  abstract={In this project, we transferred Problem-Based Learning (PBL), a well-known pedagogy for medical education, to an online environment by transforming it into a simulation where students could practice their skills collaboratively in a risk-free setting. This paper describes the design of a conceptual model and development of a software platform to allow learners to collaborate online in discussing PBL cases. Early testing has been extremely promising, largely due to the extensive work done earlier to build the ENJEUX-S online game platform. Thanks to this work, it has been possible to extend this platform from online games to online simulations. Our first test of the PBL model with undergraduate students was successful in facilitating their critical thinking and was well-received. We are now planning to use COMPSoft in medical schools and to conduct comprehensive evaluation studies of both the model and the platform.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In this paper we introduce a jigsaw-puzzle model to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in students. We then use our model to craft and add innovative lab assignments to “Digital Systems”, which is a core course taken by Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science students worldwide. In each lab assignment, students are provided with some components or puzzle pieces as well as the user guide of a digital system, and possibly some reading materials to better understand the operation theory of the system. One selling point of our model is its significant flexibility, so that the game may be played in different ways. Here is one example: students go over the user guide and the reading materials to get a solid understating of the underlying digital system. To comprehend what they have available, students also study the puzzle pieces. Then students challenge themselves to complete the puzzle and eventually build the digital system physically and test it. The resulting system is supposed to function in accordance with its user guide. Our work is an attempt to fulfill the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) Students Outcomes. The anonymous survey from the students is encouraging and shows that our work is able to excite students' curiosity, provide them with an opportunity to apply creative thinking, and instill in students a feeling of value creation among other things.},

  abstract={As a vital risk to the public heath, suicide has been a hot topic for related research. Time perspectives (TPs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years in that making use of TPs can help gain insights into the real motives behind suicide ideation. TPs take into consideration how people think of or appraise their past, present, or future life would shape their behavior. Conventional TP-oriented studies on suicide tendency detection tend to rely on questionnaire surveys to help identify suicide thoughts or attempts. Such efforts suffer from weaknesses including low data collection efficiency and self-report bias. We proposed a TP-enhanced deep multitask model, TP-GloVe-GRU, in which TP is regarded as the synergy of both time and emotions. The model performance was evaluated against the CEASE dataset using a range of metrics. Results show that incorporating TP into the detection of suicide ideation leads to a better performance in most cases with an increase of 2.27% in the accuracy of suicide risk assessment.},

  abstract={Learners nowadays are susceptible to stress and boredom due to the prevalence of e-learning. Young adults form their personalities in the context of dynamic networks that heavily depend on technological advances. As a way to involve learners, game-based learning refers to the adoption of some gaming ideas and their adaptation to actual contexts. Computer and video games can give e-learners the opportunity to engage in educational strategies that emphasize practical immersion and are accompanied by frameworks that foster competence, professionalism, and creative thinking. Through this study, the authors explore the use of game-based learning in the higher education sector in India. The authors aim to understand e-learners’ perceptions regarding game-based learning especially as elearning is growing in popularity and to bring out the various factors that contribute to the success of game-based learning in higher education. Based on the study, the authors also propose a 6C Strategy Model highlighting various strategies that faculty members and educators can use. The model will enable faculty members to effectively utilize game-based learning to keep the e-learners motivated and engaged throughout the e-learning process.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This paper presents An Intelligent Agent Model for a Given Task in a Specified Environment. The methodology in this work is based on mixing algorithmic and function approaches to construct the intelligent agent model. The paper concentrates on building an intelligent agent model as a knowledge-based system interacting with dynamic environment to perform tasks. The class structure used to represent the environment in the knowledge base depends on three types of knowledge representation forms: production rule, semantic net, and frames. Each object in the environment is an instance of the class environment. Algorithms and functions are used for gaining knowledge from the state space of environment to build the task. The intelligent agent model can understand the environment from any position and can detect many subtasks, arrange them in a queue for execution, and has the ability to make a decision at a high level of thinking. The intelligent agent model is able to calculate the persistent changes in the external dynamic environment and any sudden change, such as observing the existence of any obstacle in the environment and avoiding it. The intelligent agent is also able to learn and take the reasonable decision in the dynamic environment and automatically select action based on task characteristics. Therefore, the intelligent agent can solve many different types of problems.},

  abstract={In a physicalist theory of mind, a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. They can help us classify newly encountered objects on the basis of our past experiences. But how can we get the concepts? As visual information account for about 80% of total perceptual information, this paper proposes a concept acquisition method based on visual cognition. Firstly, we give a new definition of concept based on the classic views. Then, we imitate the process of visual cognition to get the approximate locations of the salient proto-objects. By using the improved cerebral cortex learning algorithm, the concepts of the objects can be acquired. However, the whole model also has top-down process. The concepts learned in turn affect the former saliency-based region selection method. We demonstrate that the suggested method can not only yield dynamic and phase-smooth concepts, but also recognize objects with good precise. Our findings will facilitate further studies on human thinking.},

  abstract={The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various fields, especially education, where their ability to generate human-like text enhances writing efficiency. However, these advancements present challenges in developing students' critical thinking and writing skills. Therefore, important to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text to maintain academic integrity. This study proposes a machine-learning approach that utilizes an ensemble of RoBERTa transformer models to classify AI-generated text in English essays. The proposed method combines three variants of the RoBERTa model with different training parameters to improve the classification model's performance. Evaluation results show good performance with a precision of 99.560%, a recall of 97.839%, and an F1-score of 98.692%. These results outperform the individual RoBERTa models and traditional machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The findings highlight the effectiveness of using an ensemble method with RoBERTa transformer models for the classification of AI-generated text. This research contributes to the development of AI-generated text classification models and offers solutions to the challenges faced in education due to the growth of LLM.},

  abstract={First engineering and science formation units (blocks) of Tec21 competences-based model [1], defined by Tecnologico de Monterrey, include students solving a real challenge supported by knowledge obtained in modules on mathematics, physics, and computing. A new challenge "Design, construction and modeling of a water-powered rocket" was proposed for the F1007B "Modeling in Engineering with Conservation Laws" block. This challenge involves designing, modeling and construction of a rocket, powered by a jet of water due to the pressure of a hand pump. Students compete in teams to achieve the greatest distance with their rockets. The educational intention of this challenge is to enhance student learning experience by (1) Covering many more topics of Physics that can been applied by students (2) Improve students grades and professor evaluation, (3) Increasing the use of technology by incorporating the Tracker program for video analysis, (4) Enabling comparison of real results with those obtained through MATLAB modeling, and (5) Fostering enthusiasm among students by facilitating teams’ competition within the same class and even among different campuses. Considering the analysis made, it was observed that the water rocket contest helped most of the students to better understand the concepts of Physics included in this block and in the previous block, F1006B "Modeling the Movement in Engineering". The topics in this unit include the Principle of conservation of energy, the Principle of conservation of lineal momentum, Bernoulli’s Principle, Projectile motion and Air friction. A large percentage of students consider that this activity was good for using technological tools such as Matlab (72%) or Tracker (84%) and to compare theory with reality. A good number of students believe that this challenge helped them develop and implement solutions, demonstration of operation of engineering systems and devices, written language, and scientific thinking competences. It can be concluded that this rocket contest challenge is a good educational innovation since it incorporates a change in the materials, methods, contents and contexts involved in the formation unit.},

  abstract={In the higher education system, the introduction of information technologies is part of the modern unit of education. At the present time, when universities commonly use the form of distance and mixed education, this method places the student at the center of the entire educational system and among all other components related to this system. Supporting the development of skills, competencies, critical thinking, communication, and expressing ideas and concepts naturally, in a free form, stimulate the student. The motivation of individuals has a great influence on education and even on learning itself. These information technologies can implicitly greatly enhance motivation and also education through innovative teaching, learning, and assessment technologies. Motivation is increased through interactivity, dynamics, and effects provided by information technology. Virtual reality (VR) is the most interactive of these technologies. The contribution is devoted to the use of virtual reality in the educational process, where the basis of the use of virtual reality is the effort to display spatial models and scenes as faithfully as possible, their manipulation, the creation of the real world, a certain part of it with all its regularities and rules, movement in three-dimensional space and that all in real-time. In doing so, basic procedures from the field of computer graphics are used.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of computer technology, artificial intelligence, an important branch of the discipline, has been undergoing constant changes. The essence of artificial intelligence is the use of computer technology to simulate the human way of thinking and a series of intelligent behaviors, such as co-ordination, thinking, reasoning and so on. In intelligent robots, AI (artificial intelligence) language processing systems, image recognition systems and various types of expert systems, complex computer algorithms are used to simulate certain logical reasoning of the human brain, so as to achieve the intelligence of equipment. Against the background of global economic integration and accelerated informationization, artificial intelligence technology is developing rapidly. This paper presents a distributed model cloud platform based on Kubernetes architecture for data transfer, distributed concurrent multitasking and functional business requirements through virtualization and model componentization techniques. The platform adopts a three-tier structure of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service), and combines with ArcGIS and modern Web technologies to realize efficient visualization display. We evaluate the performance of AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and IBM Cloud in terms of deep learning model training and inference performance, and the experimental results show that Google Cloud and Azure are the best performers in terms of training time and accuracy as well as inference speed, while AWS and IBM Cloud excel in terms of scalability and security. Ultimately, this paper provides an important reference for organizations when choosing a cloud service provider to support deep learning applications.},

  abstract={While feedforward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been a great success in computer vision, it is important to note that the human visual cortex generally contains more feedback than feedforward connections. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in deep neural networks. In addition to the feedforward inference in traditional neural networks, a feedback loop is introduced to infer the activation status of hidden layer neurons according to the "goal" of the network, e.g., high-level semantic labels. We analogize this mechanism as "Look and Think Twice." The feedback networks help better visualize and understand how deep neural networks work, and capture visual attention on expected objects, even in images with cluttered background and multiple objects. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate its effectiveness in solving tasks such as image classification and object localization.},

  abstract={Growing electricity demand, the deployment of renewable energy sources and the widespread use of smart home appliances provide new opportunities for home energy management systems (HEMSs), which can be defined as systems that improve the overall energy production and consumption of residential buildings by controlling and scheduling the use of household equipment. By saving energy, reducing residential electricity costs, optimizing the utilization rate and reliability of utility companies’ power systems, and reducing air pollution for society, HEMSs lead to an enhancement in the socioeconomic development of low-carbon economies. This review aims to systematically analyze and summarize the development trends and challenges of HEMSs in recent years. This paper reviews the development history of the HEMS architecture and discusses the characteristics of several major communication technologies in the current HEMS infrastructure. In addition, the common objectives and constraints related to scheduling optimization are classified, and several optimization methods in the literature, including various intelligent algorithms, have been introduced, compared, and critically analyzed. Furthermore, experimental studies and challenges in the real world are also summarized and recommendations are given. This paper reveals the trend from simple to complex in the architecture and functionality of HEMSs, discusses the challenges for future improvements in modeling and scheduling, and shows the development of various modeling and scheduling methods. Based on this review, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of current research trends in HEMSs and open up ideas for developing new modeling and scheduling approaches by gaining insight into the trade-offs between optimum solutions and computational complexity.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, indoor localization has been a topic of interest for both the academic and industrial communities. The need for location estimation, fueled mainly by inaccuracies of GPS indoors, has been addressed by specifically designed systems achieving a high localization accuracy but with a high deployment cost. Lately, dedicated systems are being replaced by smartphones through intelligent use of the built-in sensors. For instance, an accelerometer that can detect user activity can be combined with a wireless radio that captures wireless signal strength information to locate a user. With the advent of such technology, a myriad of systems have been proposed in the literature presenting an indefinite picture to a reader as to which systems actually work and which do not given practical considerations. This article takes up the goal of surveying state-of-the-art smartphone based indoor localization systems with critical analysis on their properties such as accuracies across various sensor designs, energy consumption and computational cost, user satisfaction and so on, thereby providing a status quo of such systems.},

  abstract={In this paper, we critically analyze the performance of an intelligent Long-Term Evolution-Uplink (LTE-UL) system having a cognitive engine (CE) embedded in e-NodeB. Performance characterization, optimal radio parameters prediction, and inter-cell-interference coordination (ICIC) are studied. The embedded CE allocates the optimal radio parameters to serving users and suggests the acceptable transmit power to users served by adjacent cells for ICIC. The desired cognition has been achieved with a novel random neural network (RNN) based CE architecture. To achieve the best learning performance, we critically analyzed three learning algorithms, gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIW-PSO) and differential evolution (DE). The analysis showed that AIW-PSO was 10.57% better than GD and 8.012% better than DE in terms of learning accuracy (based on MSE), but with considerable compromise on computational time as compared to GD. Moreover, in terms of convergence time (to achieve the MSE less than 1.04E-03), AIW-PSO took 60% less iterations than GD and 50% less than DE.},

  abstract={Public perceptions of a brand is critical to its performance. While social media has demonstrated a huge potential to shape public perceptions of brands, existing tools are not intuitive and explanatory for domain users to use as they fail to provide a comprehensive analysis framework for perceptions of brands. In this paper, we present SocialBrands, a novel visual analysis tool for brand managers to understand public perceptions of brands on social media. Social-Brands leverages brand personality framework in marketing literature and social computing approaches to compute the personality of brands from three driving factors (user imagery, employee imagery, and official announcement) on social media, and construct an evidence network explaining the association between brand personality and driving factors. These computational results are then integrated with new interactive visualizations to help brand managers understand personality traits and their driving factors. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of SocialBrands through a series of user studies with brand managers in an enterprise context. Design lessons are also derived from our studies.},

  abstract={The arrival of the digital home, signals a new era for both manufacturers and consumers. It raises the possibility that people may be able to create their own unique digital home functionalities, by combining elemental network services to create sophisticated "virtual appliances" that satisfy their individual needs and desires. We present taxonomy of approaches for customising digital homes and use this to introduce a novel computational methodology, that we term 'pervasive interactive programming' (PiP), that allows non-technical end-users to build their own "virtual appliances"for customising their 'electronic environments' without the need to write program code. We show this approach is novel in that it firstly allows the user to translate mental concepts into functions (which differs to agent based approaches using historical behaviour data to form functions) and secondly it moves "programming-by-example" from single processor computers into real-time distributed embedded computing environments. Finally we report on a small evaluation which showed it was possible for non-programmers to use these tools to customise the electronic functionality of their digital homes.},

  abstract={Modern Smart Grids (SGs) are characterized by the simultaneous presence of time-varying and non-linear loads as well as distributed energy sources with power converters which contribute to wide spectra waveform distortions. Moreover, one of the crucial device of the SG architectures is the smart metering systems which utilize high frequencies for the power line communication (PLC) transmission. In particular, the presence of spectral components in the range of 2÷ 150kHz (supraharmonics) has recently become an issue of great interest due to the interaction between widespread diffusion of high-spectral emission devices (e.g., end-user devices and converter-interfaced distributed generation systems) and power line communication systems. The complexity of these waveforms distortions makes their assessment a challenge. This paper critically analyses and compares two methods proposed in recent literature which seem particularly suitable for the spectral analysis of waveforms with wide spectra. One of the methods is based on the sliding-window discrete Fourier transform (SWDFT) referring to IEC standard harmonic estimation. The second method utilizes the sliding-window wavelet-modified ESPRIT-based method (SWWMEM). This is a companion document to a paper of the same title, Part II, where the methods are tested on synthetic and measured waveforms in terms of accuracy and computational efforts.},

  abstract={The intersection of computer science and art has sparked a wave of innovation, particularly in digital visualizations and interactive installations. This abstract explores the symbiotic relationship between these disciplines, highlighting groundbreaking advancements and creative endeavors. Innovations in digital visualizations leverage algorithms and computational techniques to transform data into visually engaging representations. From intricate data sculptures to immersive virtual reality experiences, computer scientists and artists collaborate to push the boundaries of storytelling and communication. These visualizations not only convey complex information effectively but also evoke emotional responses, bridging the gap between technology and human perception. Interactive installations blur the lines between audience and artwork, inviting participation and engagement. Through sensors, augmented reality, and responsive environments, users become active participants in the creation of art, shaping and influencing their experiences in real-time. This dynamic interaction fosters new forms of expression and challenges traditional notions of artistic production. By exploring the intersection of computer science and art, this abstract underscores the transformative power of interdisciplinary collaboration. Through experimentation, exploration, and innovation, digital visualizations and interactive installations continue to redefine the possibilities of creative expression in the digital age.},

  year={2011},

  abstract={P2P systems are currently considered as an important and effective alternative to web-based centric approaches of groupware systems. Decentralisation, direct and interactive communication, personalization and context are among the features of P2P systems that could be beneficial to groupware systems. In particular, such features can support monitoring, awareness, social networking and scaffolding in group collaboration. In this work we present an analysis of advantages in using P2P networks to better support group collaborative processes. In our analysis, P2P groupware systems are conceived as a convergence of several views: contextual computing, social media and semantic web. The contextual computing is an important ingredient to capture the context of the collaboration in a multi-dimension way, including workspace context, documents and information context, time and location contexts, etc. The social media is also considered important for an effective collaboration of peer group, to support members with efficient and scalable communication techniques in social interaction among members. The semantic web concepts and use of languages such as RDF/S enable the representation and reasoning with the diverse range of information required by the P2P middleware and the awareness services. We focus in particular how to achieve event-based awareness in P2P groupware systems that includes different forms of awareness. The user and technical requirements are first derived with reference to Project-Based Learning in P2P learning environments, which is the learning setting that we consider in our work. We then present our computational model for supporting group awareness in such environments and discuss how it meets the identified user and technical requirements.},

  abstract={Metaheuristics have been employed in solving several optimization and NP-hard problems owing to their ability to avoid local optima entrapment, flexibility and robustness, simplicity, and reasonable computational time. In this work, an empirical analysis is carried out on the application of metaheuristics in solving the protein structure prediction (PSP) problem. The PSP problem entails predicting a three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins based on the amino acid sequences. This study employs the Ab Initio method, which relies on the thermodynamic properties of the proteins, such as the minimal free energy levels, bond angles, and torsional angles, in determining the protein structure. Five real protein sequences, namely 1CB3, 1BXL, 2H3S, 1TZ4, and 1CRN from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and 11 metaheuristics including DE, GA, PSO, DSO, ACO, and HS were employed in the empirical analysis. Moreover, extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to generate the results of the empirical analysis and these results were statistically tested using the Friedman test.},

  abstract={Architecture was perceived for many centuries as the design of static buildings that will last for extended periods of time, with static changes or additions at most. Traditional design tools reflect this approach. Kinetic architecture, however, defines a kind of architecture that incorporates dynamic properties which accommodate for environmental or utilization changes. The integration of mechanics, electronics, and computer technology into contemporary architectural design, requires a change of thinking and designing, as well as suitable design tools. To communicate design ideas, the architectural design process utilizes effective strategies such as sketching and model building. A well-established design technique in diverse disciplines is rapid prototyping. Our goal is to have an integrated environment for designing kinetic architecture, including its mechanical parts, electronic units, and software modules with a rapid prototyping approach. This paper discusses conceptual ideas for rapid prototyping design environments for kinetic architecture. An exemplary environment is introduced where a small design task has been realized to provide feedback for the concept.},
