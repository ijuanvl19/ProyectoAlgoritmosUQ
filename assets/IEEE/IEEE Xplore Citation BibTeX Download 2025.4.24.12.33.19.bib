  abstract={This work examines how machine awareness has changed over time by examining mathematical module complexity using a new technique that combines historical study, real-world testing, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. We can completely comprehend how mathematical complexity influences machine intelligence with the provided strategy. Our method begins with a detailed examination of AI's mathematical underpinnings' evolution. This historical perspective shows how arithmetic has affected robot thinking. Second, real-world trials evaluate machine learning and mathematical models. These approaches are evaluated on accuracy, precision, memory, F1 score, mean squared error, and computing efficiency. The comparison shows that the recommended strategy outperforms six well-known strategies that employ many criteria. Results show the proposed strategy works. Traditional approaches can't match its 95% accuracy. The approach is more beneficial than normal methods since it has superior accuracy, memory, and F1 scores. A smaller mean squared error indicates that the recommended strategy predicts better than current methods. Its 7.2 millisecond processing time makes it the most computing-efficient option. This unique methodology lets us understand how machine intelligence has evolved and choose the optimal solutions for particular occupations. The recommended technique is effective for studying the complex link between mathematical modules and AI progress since it incorporates historical background and cuttingedge algorithms.},

  title={Incrementalization of Vertex-Centric Programs}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1019-1029},
  abstract={As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1118-1123},
  abstract={Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of "extremeness". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.},

  abstract={The Black Box is a system with the internal organization and behavior about which the observer has no information. However, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs. The paper is concerned with the implementation of “black box” type of activities to teach computational thinking. The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution. We found out that a lot of the students were not able to think about the concept of the application functioning and were not able to create any formal description of algorithms.},

  abstract={Computer science as a discipline encompasses the study and creation of computational techniques for problem-solving. Unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. A considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. This paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. In the proposed architecture, a core lecture is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitation/laboratory sections. The focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. The recitation/laboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. The objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking.},

  abstract={The human mind is a truly remarkable thing that does so much that we are not even aware of. Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way to a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects. Using BCI to control a drone will open the way toward smooth and high-response flight. Deep learning is a new-age skill that has made many breakthroughs and influenced modern technologies. It has made it possible to predict and identify even the most complex and abstract patterns that even we humans would be very challenged to catch ourselves. In this paper, a method of controlling a drone using BCI has been presented using an 8-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Deep learning has been employed to process and classify human brain waves. After testing the resulting deep learning algorithm, the overall classification accuracy was 90% to distinguish between four different movements of the drone.},

We are currently designing such studies and hope that they will eventually result in validated measurements that can be used to prevent companies from investing in the wrong areas when trying to move towards more agility.},

Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way toward a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects. Furthermore, a reliable design of a BCI-based Internet of Things (IoT) system is still in the early stages because it still has several challenges, such as the issue of accurately implementing the individual's intention. This paper presents a method for brain waves recognition using deep learning based on shapes and colors for use in merging concepts of the IoT and BCI, which we defined as the “Internet of Brain Controlled Things (IoBCT).” We used a low-cost 8-channel Electroencephalography (EEG) headset, and the results showed an acceptable accuracy of 93% in the brain waves pattern recognition, which opens the way for designing a reliable IoBCT.},

  abstract={Computer Science contains many abstract concepts, which are both difficult to teach, and to comprehend. Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.},

  abstract={The system aims to direct the user to create their network system collaboratively for a case of Covid-19 health throughout a case study in a Web System and E-Commerce course. The framework of directed health learning is based on 7x2C content knowledge established criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The self-design frame framework is plan-oriented and based on the concept of a plan and plans integrations and special relationships. The user is directed to break the system into plans and the design is to self-guide the user to build a system to comprehend, combat, coexist, cope, and trace COVID-19 with four layers of diagnostics, simulation, and pattern matching database. With the collaboration of users' systems, a fact from one user as output can be transferred to another user as an input in a circulation forming a general fact. Consequently, the transfer of learning from one system flows into another system resulting in a pattern to be found. Based on the pattern an algorithm will formulate to tackle a solution to COVID19. The implication of this study will be a guideline for others to initiate their own participant's system to find a pattern and formulate an algorithm for the pandemic. The idea of self-design and self-directed learning can be transferred to other fields of study covid-19 health.

  abstract={The advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has driven revolutionary applications like ChatGPT. The widespread use of these applications relies on a mixture of experts (MoE), which contains multiple experts, and selectively engages them for each task to lower operation costs while maintaining performance. Despite MoE, GAI faces challenges in resource consumption when deployed on user devices. Hence, this article proposes mobile edge networks supported MoE-based GAI. We first review the MoE from traditional AI and GAI perspectives, including structure, principles, and applications. We then propose a framework that transfers subtasks to experts in mobile edge networks, aiding GAI model operation on user devices. We discuss challenges in this process and introduce a deep rein-forcement learning-based algorithm to select edge experts for subtask execution. Experimental results show that our framework not only facilitates GAI's deployment on resource-limited devices, but also generates higher-quality content compared to methods without edge network support.},

  abstract={Spreadsheet-based tools provide a simple yet effective way of calculating values, which makes them the number-one choice for building and formalizing simple models for budget planning and many other applications. A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.},

  abstract={This concept of evolvable, process-oriented modular systems may be viewed as a new business model to sustain European competitiveness in micro and mini assembly. It is clear that this business model implies a high dynamic lifecycle for shop floors. The system will move from a static life cycle since the modules that create the different systems will live beyond the product lifecycle. This dynamicity imposes strong requirements on the way systems are designed, installed, operated, and reengineered. Re-configurability is not enough. These requirements will not only have an impact on the individual control architecture of the modules but also on, and this is very important, how the system is created, and several types of co-existing architectures},

  abstract={Scratch has been shown as one of the main tools for teaching Computational Thinking through the concept of(block-based) programming. In the present research, two platforms based on/inspired by Scratch were considered for the analysis of their usability characteristics through the Cognitive Walkthrough method, for later use by engineering students at the beginning of their university courses for the development of their competences of logical thinking and abstraction of complex concepts: Snap4Arduino (used in the development of solutions for Internet of Things), and; App Inventor (used in the development of Android applications). The results show a positive evaluation of these tools, generating motivation for their use by new engineering students in their teaching-learning processes.},
