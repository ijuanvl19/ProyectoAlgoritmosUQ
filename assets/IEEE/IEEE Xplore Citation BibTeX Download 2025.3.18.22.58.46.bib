  abstract={This paper indepth study the related issues of Available Transfer Capability (ATC). Real-coded Mind Evolution Algorithm (RMEA) model is constructed which is fit for the characteristics of ATC. It improves the accuracy and effectiveness of the results of ATC. Real-coded method is used to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm and avoid the mapping error caused by binary code. The handling of inequality constraints uses the method of non-stationary multi-stage assignment penalty function. IEEE-30 bus system is used in simulation calculation. Comparing with results gained by Benders decomposition and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO), the results prove the rationality and validity of this proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we do performance statistics and analysis for some different situation taking Rosen Brock function as example, from statistics we think that local model is better than global model in avoiding premature, and neighborhood size is not important, number of particles should be enough large to distributed as uniformly as possible in search space, and the same times it should smaller than iteration times to complete information flow among particles. Based on this statistics we present a weighted PSO model, test result shows that our model's performance is better than basic PSO model.},

  abstract={Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={814-818},
  abstract={In this paper, we compare and analyze the prediction performance of existing ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) models. The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant.},

  abstract={Color harmony is an important factor affecting the aesthetic feeling of images and plays an important role in visual perception. It can evaluate the feasibility of images by constructing the computational model of human aesthetic thinking. In this paper, a color harmony evaluation method based on color complexity was implemented. Given the classical color harmony model which is suitable for the simple color combination but not suitable for the complex image, and the local feature redundancy caused by grid sampling, an adaptive sampling based on CCM(color complexity measure) was implemented. Then, K-means was adopted to extract local color harmony features. Finally, a model was constructed between local color harmony features and the overall color harmony by SVM. The results show that the method implemented in this paper can represent the color harmony of complex images accurately and effectively.},

  pages={21-27},
  abstract={The ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar plays an important role in surveillance, precision tracking, and classification of ground moving targets. The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost.},

  year={2009},
  volume={},

  pages={2109-2116},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a model for the generation of ideas within a creative thinking/brainstorming context. In the model, ideas emerge as conceptual combinations from the interaction of complex dynamics at several semantic levels: features, concepts, categories, and previously generated ideas. This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system. We also briefly describe a computational model for ideation in groups using a multi-agent formalism. The initial focus of this model is on studying the potential benefits of cognitive diversity in agent groups, e.g., the presence of convergent and divergent thinkers, or agents with different semantic organizations.},

  abstract={A positive collaboration between students and professors in any course regardless of the offering mode, i.e., online or in-class setting, can play a significant role in students' success in the class. Thus, any model of teaching/learning should include a unique component of human interaction (i.e., interaction between instructors and students) to make such models appropriate for implementation. The nature of online courses is such that there is no physical interaction between the instructors and students. Thus, the development and implementation of these models, with constructive collaboration between students and instructors in mind, is more challenging for the instructors. In this paper, we examine issues related to the partnership between students and instructors in online courses and propose steps that can be taken to make this collaboration not only feasible but also effective in persuading students to participate in the partnership throughout the semester actively.},

  pages={000197-000202},
  abstract={In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.},

  abstract={Collaborative learning in higher education, such as the emerging makerspaces, has contributed to research on innovation and participant expertise. However, there is little research on knowledge management in makerspaces or how learners transfer their individual tacit knowledge in the collaborative space. In addition, the functionality of maker education to promote individualized and personalized learning still needs to be explored. This study is based on Chinese STEM graduate students’ experiences with project-based learning in a Maker Education environment to test how AIGC tools help to acquire and transfer students’ individual tacit knowledge. The sample was formed from 266 MPhil students taking the "Design Thinking and Effective Academic Communication" course in their first academic year at the world’s first interdisciplinary university in southern China. The AIGC teaching intervention was based on the four-phase knowledge management model. In a cycle of socialization-externalization-combination-internalization,learners first explore expertise in a research area in project teams and formulate their research interest. Then, storytelling, analogy, and metaphor data were first used to assess students’ abilities to communicate their research topic in text and images on an A4 paper. The subsequent AIGC-supported instructional intervention consisted of 20-minute instructional Sprints with two instructors from Computational Media Arts and Academic Communication over two consecutive weeks. The students’ work shows that combining AIGC tools allows for a higher quality of visualization of tacit knowledge in the combination phase -.},

  abstract={Dance choreography is an intense, creative and intuitive process. A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities.

Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count. The details of experimental study performed for the Genetic Algorithm based art to SMart (System Modelled art) system along with the results obtained are also presented in this paper.},

  abstract={Artificial neural network (ANN) community is engaged in biological plausibility issues these days. Different views about this subject can lead to disagreements of classification criteria among ANN researchers. In order to contribute to this debate, two of these views are highlighted here: one is related directly to the cerebral cortex biological structure, and the other focuses the neural features and the signaling between neurons. The model proposed in this paper considers that a biologically more plausible ANN has the purpose to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities, including learning processes, of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models upon which the proposed description is based takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and inter-neuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses. Also, the duration of action potentials is taken into account. In addition to the characteristics for encoding information regarding biological plausibility present in current spiking neuron models, a distinguishable feature is emphasized here: a combination of Hebbian learning and error-driven learning.},

To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees. If organization wants to select potential employees to become chief and predicts them achieving their target, classification techniques should include all employees as the population and avoid to choose only subsets to ensure the confidence of result. Meanwhile, KL-Divergence function generates competencies that affect employee who become a chief and achieve the target. They are achievement orientation, adaptability, analytical thinking, communication and information seeking.},

  abstract={The cloud model is good at bridging the gap between qualitatives and quantities, and so it was applied to evaluating mildew degree of rice seeds based on machine vision. A symmetric cloud and two asymmetric clouds were designed to express three qualitative concepts and the relationship between them. These three qualitative concepts represent different mildew degree including non-mildew, spot mildew and severe mildew. The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way. An experiment was conducted to test on the classifier based on cloud and another classifier based on neural network. The results showed that the classification accuracy of cloud classifier was higher than the classification accuracy of neural network.},

  abstract={Generative AI faces many challenges when entering the product design workflow, such as interface usability and interaction patterns. Therefore, based on design thinking and design process, we developed the DesignGPT multi-agent collaboration framework, which uses artificial intelligence agents to simulate the roles of different positions in the design company and allows human designers to collaborate with them in natural language. Experimental results show that compared with separate AI tools, DesignGPT improves the performance of designers, highlighting the potential of applying multi-agent systems that integrate design domain knowledge to product scheme design.},

  abstract={Conceptual design and design knowledge representation have been popular research directions in fields of brain science and intelligent design. This paper proposes the Feature Prototype Model (FPM) to represent the design knowledge of a product with its design features and prototypes. Accordingly, a product conceptual space is constructed using FPM with Wikipedia data, which is a giant database of manually defined concepts and semantic relations. Through case studies, we propose that the FPM based product conceptual space presents the knowledge involved in design activities and depicts the cognitive environment involved in design thinking.},

  abstract={The research focus of computer chess is how to use computer to abstract and formalize the logical thinking activities of human beings in chess game. This paper designs and implements a No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning. During the game, MCTS algorithm is used to explore the legal situation under the current situation. In this process, the convolutional neural network is used to evaluate the explored situation. Then, the neural network is trained to evaluate the situation with the results of the match, so as to achieve the effect of self-improving algorithm without human experience. In addition, the author used the Union-Find to find the legal landing point on the chessboard. Finally, the experiment shows that this type of No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning can be improved by itself and reach a certain level of chess ability, which improves the efficiency of searching legal moves compared with the traditional No-Go chessboard traversal method.},

  abstract={Semantic Web is, without a doubt, gaining momentum in both industry and academia. With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the naïve approach of searching information on the syntactic web is cliché. Why do we think that the web would be improved, if it understood the meaning of its contents? Doesn't it understand it now? Google is very good at correcting typing mistakes, figuring out what I “meant” when I miss-typed a query or suggesting keyword to expand our search query. In this paper we redefine the idea of searching optimised information on the web using Capture-Recapture method. This paper also explains an optimised semantic searching of keywords and detailed explanation and simulation on Ontology of Indian Universities.},
