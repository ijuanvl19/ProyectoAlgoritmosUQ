  abstract={A fuzzy node is a fuzzy set whose membership function contains some uncertain parameters. Two fuzzy nodes are connected if the uncertain parameter of one node is provided by the fuzzy set from the other node. A fuzzy network is a connection of a number of fuzzy nodes. We define Gaussian Fuzzy Networks and study a number of basic connections in details, including basic center, basic standard deviation (sdv), basic center-sdv, chain-in-center, chain-in-sdv, self-feedback and some other connections. We derive the membership functions resulting from these connections that reveal how the fuzziness is propagated through the networks, and we explain what the mathematical results mean with respect to human behaviors.},

  abstract={Work design theory research has a long and rich tradition in the industrial and organisational psychology. Work design identifies tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities in a specific job. It provides a comprehensive job description useful for examining and creating optimal working conditions, also by developing empowering workers or by restructuring their responsibilities. Human-robot interaction is among the domains with a high demand for work design. It is related to the widespread human fear of being replaced by machines at work, as well as the still small number of publications in this field, mostly devoted to human-robot interaction analysis conditions. Scholars have identified an elaborated set of tasks by a human during working with a robot. From work design perspective, besides expanding what tasks are considered, it is crucial to consider its meaning for creating critical psychological states, which are important for individual and organisational results. Thus, the paper preparation’s impetus describes and analyses the tasks carried out by robot operators in a more precise manner, by using psychological work analysis from the work design perspective. The research group consists of 32 robot operators from a large international manufacturing company. The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) was used to describe 21 of work characteristics. Results show that Task Variety, Information Processing, Task Identity, Specialisation, Skill Variety, Problem-solving, Task Significance, Received Interdependence, Feedback From Others, and Feedback from Job are the highest work characteristics of robot operators. It suggests that robot operators distinguish non-routine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks as more substantial than other tasks. Alike, according to the work design theory, the work characteristics indicated by respondents are recognised as important job-specific factors for workers’ critical psychological states i.e., experiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts, and helping shape the context of the work. It is imperative that further and more extensive research is conducted to bring more attention to how work design can support individuals’ cognitive, social, and identity development in human-robot interaction.},

In this paper, we consider the some important field of machine learning conduct a critical survey and analysis of machine language security and its importance, attacks and threats, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape in cybersecurity. We begin by elucidating the fundamental concepts and terminologies associated with ML attacks, laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration. Subsequently, we categorize and dissect various types of ML attacks, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model inversion, and membership inference, among others. Real-world case studies and examples across different domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing, are scrutinized to reveal the intricacies and implications of these attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate existing defense mechanisms and countermeasures, assessing their effectiveness against different attack scenarios. Finally, we discuss the broader societal impacts and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of ML technologies in security-critical applications. this paper provides the tools to handle the machine language’s attacks and their solution using integration of academic research with real world examples.},

  abstract={this paper examines the relationships between job satisfaction and selected personality traits. The main task of this study is to emphasize the role of personality traits in the employee's job satisfaction and to study the impact of personality traits such as neuroticism, extraversion and psychoticism on job satisfaction. The variables include big five personality traits and job satisfaction. The main focus of this work reveals that there is no substantial link within the following big five factors and the job satisfaction. The above-mentioned factors would importantly impact on job satisfaction. The examination of linkage between factors like neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and job satisfaction was carried out using the correlation analyzing. This study was conducted to collect the main data using the purposive sampling method. The distinctive feature of this study is the collection, processing and analysis of consolidated information from personal questionnaires depending on the type of professional activity of the sixty employees in aviation industry. Two questionnaires i.e. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-revised (EPQ-R) and Job Satisfaction Survey were used to make an assessment of the impact of personality traits on the overall level of job satisfaction. The future impact of this study can support to increase the productivity level of the employees and also, spread awareness about the positive impact of extraverted personality traits on the job satisfaction.},

  pages={605-610},
  abstract={The interest in deep neural networks for solving computer vision task has dramatically increased. Due to the heavy influence of the neural networks architecture on its predictive accuracy, neural architecture search has gained much attention in recent years. This research area typically implies a high computational burden and thus, requires high scalability as well as availability to ensure no data loss or waist of computational power. Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1,000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Our results show that the introduced multi-objective neural architecture search can easily handle even the loss of nodes and proceed the algorithm within seconds on another node without any loss of results or the necessity of human interaction.},

  pages={3220-3227},
  abstract={This paper proposes a two-tiered, evolutionary architecture for computer based synthesis of textures. In this architecture, a traditional tree based texture generation system is controlled by a set of evolutionary agents. The main contribution of this work is that the user is able to choose the degree of interaction and control they exert over the system. Evolutionary agents are designed to contain information about desirable image features, and they evolve based on user feedback. The agents in turn control the main evolutionary engine for generating textures. This system allows the computer to continue working when the designer leaves without limiting the designerpsilas ability to control the texture generation process when they are available to interact with the system. An experimental implementation is developed to verify the utility of the proposed architecture for texture synthesis. Results show significant improvements in the average user ranking of the agents as the genetic algorithm progresses.},

  title={Value-transformation for monotone prediction by approximating fuzzy membership functions}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={367-372},
  abstract={Monotone prediction problems, in which the target variable is non-decreasing given an increase of the explanatory variables, have became more popular nowadays in many problem settings which fulfill the so-called monotonicity constraint, namely, if an object is better in all attributes as another one then it should not be classified lower. Recent approaches to monotone prediction consider linear ordering on attribute domains, thus the meaning of being better in an attribute is limited to having a larger or a lower value in that attribute. However, this limitation restricts the use of recent approaches in cases where middle or marginal values of an attribute are better, what is natural in many real-world scenarios. We present a simple attribute value-transformation approach in this paper. The idea is to map attribute domains to real values where the mapped values express how the given value of an attribute contributes to higher classification of objects. Thus, we are searching for an data-specific approximation of a fuzzy membership function on the domain of each (numerical) attribute. Then, instead of the original attribute values we use their mapped values to mitigate the violation of monotonicity constraints in the data. Our approach is quite simple and is not limited to numerical attributes only. The described approach was tested and evaluated on benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.},

  pages={192-197},
  abstract={One of the main goals of the Arabic world since decades has been to search, bring and deliver new sources and forms of art in the field of interior design and architecture that could satisfy the recent increasing human demands. Today people strive to showcase their tradition and cultural heritage in the modern world. People of Arabic Peninsula are all about representing the beauty of their Islamic culture in unique contemporary ways that would astonish the world. Arabic calligraphy is one of such sources. The distinctive geometric shapes and forms of different character types and styles like Kufi, Naskh, Diwani, Thuluth etc., gives designers the opportunity to design and develop exquisite pieces of art in both interior design and architectural field. The design elements of modern interior design act as a guiding principle infusing this art form in design. Modern Arab interior and architectural designs are incredibly unique yet sophisticated and luxurious. The usage of calligraphy in design can prove to be a substantial method of portraying history and culture expressed through the character of letters to be used in furniture, columns, ceiling, architectural buildings etc. This paper shows how Arabic calligraphy is not limited to just traditional decorative purposes but can have much wider application at both macro and micro level in modern world of design. It is a great source of inspiration for designers attempting to integrate the art of calligraphy in design of modern furniture as well as architectural structures. The paper demonstrates how designers like Zaha Hadid, and many others borrowed this traditional art form, infused it with modern touch and took it to new heights of contemporary design through their modernized lenses and vision. The ravishing amalgam of calligraphy and design can give birth to some magnificent and timeless masterpieces in future.},

Considering a knowledge representation partially ordering concepts into a directed acyclic graph, this study focuses on the problem of summarizing several human descriptions expressed through sets of concepts. We formally define the problem of summarization in this context and we propose a model mimicking a Human-like Intelligence for scoring alternatives with regard to a specific objective. Several interesting theoretical results related to this problem (e.g. for optimization) are also given. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach performed in the domain of odor analysis highlights the benefits of our proposal and shows how it could be used to automatize time-consuming expert summarizing processes.

  abstract={Traditional visual design processes often encounter significant challenges, including limited spatial visualization, time-consuming prototyping, and restricted user engagement. These limitations hamper creative exploration and reduce the overall efficiency of design workflows. To address these issues, an advanced framework integrating virtual reality (VR) technology is proposed. VR provides an immersive and interactive environment where designers can visualize projects in a three-dimensional space, rapidly prototype ideas, and simulate user interactions in real time. This approach facilitates dynamic design processes, enhances creativity, and streamlines iterative development. The proposed framework promotes seamless integration of VR into existing workflows, enabling designers to work more efficiently while fostering real-time collaboration and user-centered experimentation. Through empirical case studies, the research demonstrates the transformative potential of VR in visual innovation design. Results show that VR significantly enhances design efficiency, reduces development time, and minimizes errors by allowing designers to identify and correct flaws at early stages. Designers also reported improved engagement and heightened creative problem-solving capabilities when utilizing immersive VR environments. Despite these benefits, several challenges were identified. Hardware limitations, such as insufficient resolution and processing capacity, can hinder the use of VR for complex design tasks. Additionally, a steep learning curve may limit user adaptability when transitioning from traditional design tools to VR-based systems. To address these challenges, strategies including hardware advancements and tailored training programs are recommended to facilitate smoother adoption and more effective use of VR technology. The findings demonstrate that VR technology holds significant potential to revolutionize visual innovation design by driving efficiency, fostering collaboration, and encouraging creative exploration. As VR continues to evolve, it is expected to play a pivotal role in reshaping creative processes across various industries, providing a valuable foundation for future advancements in design innovation.},

  abstract={Now a days, the English teacher’s behavior in classroom influences the student engagement towards learning language teaching and classroom teaching behavior is a crucial aspect of teaching quality. However, the behavior of the English teachers lacks in the scalability and failed in analysis of speech, text and video teaching strategies. Therefore, in this research proposed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) namely BERT-RNN to estimate the behavior of English teacher in classroom. Initially, the experiment of English grammar writing is conducted for students with 8-weeks. The Word to Vector (Word2Vec) effectively utilized for preprocessing the data quality and it removes the punctuations and special characters. Further, data interpretation in flipped classroom model is analyzed in in three phases such as Pre-class, In-class and post-class provides the feedback of students. Finally, BERT-RNN estimates English teacher behavior by speech, text, and video data. BERT extracts meanings from teacher behaviors such as questioning and feedback. RNN tracks sequential teaching patterns. From the results the proposed BERT-RNN achieved better results in terms of Pre-structural Level(P) Unistructural Level (U) Mult structural Level (M) Relational Level (R) and Extended Abstract Level(E) compared to the experimental class and control class.},

  abstract={Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) has been studied in ways never before possible because to breakthroughs in brain imaging technology. Indirectly, the accuracy and interpretability of findings affect our understanding of neurodevelopmental processes, highlighting the crucial necessity of dependable techniques. There are a wide variety of obstacles to overcome in this field, from the intricacies of researching developing brains to the subtle interplay of different cognitive processes. Overcoming these problems demands creative approaches and enhanced procedures that can capture the changing character of cognitive growth. The goal of this framework is to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cognitive neuroscience studies, leading to a deeper comprehension of the complex mechanisms at play during brain development. In this study, there is a method called functional magnetic resonance-based tensor imaging (FMR-TI) that combines the strengths of both methods to provide more precise mapping of cognitive growth throughout time. As a bonus, the suggested method uses simulation analyses to verify its efficiency and resilience in capturing the nuances of cognitive development, making the results of the study more trustworthy. The proposed methodology can be used to a wide range of fields, such as educational neuroscience, clinical psychology, and developmental neuroscience. Understanding cognitive growth better has far-reaching effects on educational programs, diagnostic methods, and treatment plans. Moreover, this methodological improvement holds promise for unraveling the neurological foundations of neurodevelopmental diseases, helping to the development of focused therapies and tailored treatment strategies. The robustness of the processing, the flexibility of the paradigm, and the validity of the simulation are all taken into account during the investigation.},

  abstract={In art therapy, creative methods improve mental wellness. Art therapy was created to promote mental health via creative expression. Art therapy has been shown to lessen psychological disorders in children and adolescents, however it is unclear how. A systematic narrative study examined art therapy for psychosocially challenged children and adolescents. Four electronic journals and fourteen databases were investigated until January 2020. Codes were assigned to a variety of expressive modalities, therapist conduct, and purported change processes. A computer-aided design-based painting teaching model (CAD-PTM) for psychologically abused and depressed youngsters is proposed in this research. Computer graphics have several painting therapeutic applications. Computer software can simulate the real world and construct an intensive therapy system to improve painting quality. Therapist behavior and tools and expressions were flexible. These findings demonstrate that art therapy is sensitive to client requirements and situations through diverse expressions and therapist behavior. Future study should examine art therapeutic approaches, attitudes, instruments, and therapist conduct. Finally, painting therapy simulation findings show a depression rate of 20.3%, behavior rate of 93.7 %, prediction ratio of 96.2%, health outcome ratio of 95.2%, treatment ratio of 94.9, and efficiency ratio of 91.8 % compared to other approaches},

  abstract={With the growing demand for personalized and interactive cultural and creative products, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into design processes has become a promising approach to enhancing user experience and design efficiency. Traditional design methods rely heavily on manual creativity and heuristic-based approaches, which often result in inefficiencies and lack adaptability to user preferences. Existing AI-driven solutions, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have been utilized for generative design, but they often struggle with maintaining design coherence and optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an Interactive Design Structure that integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. GA is employed for evolutionary optimization of design elements, ensuring diversity and adaptability, while LSTM efficiently learns and retains long-range dependencies in user preferences and aesthetic trends. The proposed model undergoes training using a dataset of cultural and creative product designs, incorporating user feedback for iterative improvement. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of performance compared to traditional heuristic and VAE-based methods, with an accuracy of 0.97, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.99, and an F1-score of 0.95 in predicting and generating high-quality interactive designs. The proposed system enhances both efficiency and user satisfaction, making it a robust solution for intelligent cultural product design.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel real-time collaborative text editor for revolutionizing information writing. We propose the development of an all-inclusive real-time collaborative text editor that does not require separate tools for information writing and editing. Our system integrates AI-driven text synthesis, real-time collaboration, language translation, and speech recognition into one unified platform. Through this approach, users can write, translate, and generate content without having to depend on other applications but yet will enjoy all functionalities offered by a regular text editor. We aim to develop a tool with these capabilities that enhances user creativity and productivity. This all-inclusive system is designed to meet a variety of user needs, including hands-free typing via speech recognition, intelligent content creation, and multilingual communication. Our concept represents a major advancement in text editing, as it provides a unified platform that allows users to realize their full creative potential. Our goal is to revolutionize the writing industry and create powerful and versatile tools that can be used for both personal and professional purposes.},

  abstract={Collaboration performance is often enriched by the interaction of a diversity of personalities and opinions in a team. There is little research on discussion-assistance systems to monitor and control the state of diversity and cohesion of opinions. This study proposes a system that guides participants to concentrate on differences in their opinions and to reach a decision with more satisfied agreement by encouraging cognitive empathy (i.e., understanding others’ thoughts). The system evaluates the similarity of opinions among participants, then it provides feedback on the similarity score to them. Receiving the feedback, participants can determine the necessity of the exchange of opinions to converge the discussion (not debate). We prepared a team-building task in which two participants alternately presented their opinions based on individual thoughts and emotions; then, they checked the similarity between their opinions and discussed cooperatively them to reach an agreement. We show that the feedback of opinion similarity score increases cognitive empathy, which is also objectively validated by observation of brain activities. Particularly, we observed the strong phase-synchronicity of theta wave between the discussion participants’ left lateral prefrontal cortexes. Satisfaction of participants with the result of the discussion marginally increased and the similarity score of their opinions significantly increased along with the task process. In conclusion, the feedback system during the team task promoted positively the consideration of their own and their partner’s emotions and thoughts. This study also contributes to hyperscanning studies in real-life situations because it used a simple electroencephalographic device and experimental design in communication.},

  abstract={Brain signals analysis can be applied to students to identify their subject- or topic-specific struggles while they are listening to lecture videos. This re- search work proposes a threshold-based anomaly detection algorithm to identify the topics that cause students the most distress by analysing a dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanghaohan/confused-eeg/data. Firstly, it identifies the index and timestamp of distress data points of students’ brain signals, extracts the respective portion of transcribed textual content, given as prompt to ChatGPT or Bard via application programming interface (API) calls, get back the answers, and display it in a pop up window to the students. The proposed generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI)-powered intelligent tutoring system (ITS) captures almost 99% of confusion points and source confusion topic in brain signals as it uses context- aware algorithm thereby improving leaners’ clarity on the source confusion topic after reading the pop-up window content generated by Gen AI.},
