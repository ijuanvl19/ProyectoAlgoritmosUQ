  abstract={The notions of concepts and emotions are mathematically described, and an "elementary" perception-cognition process is discussed inherently involving both aspects of the psyche. The mathematical nature of perception and cognition turn out to be very similar. The developed mathematical technique is practically useful for engineering designs and also corresponds to our intuition about our psyche. The paper establishes relationships between the developed mathematical techniques, classical semiotic concepts of sign and symbol, and more general notions of symbol in culture and psychology. An important and psychologically loaded notion of symbol refers to psychic processes connecting conscious and unconscious representations (concepts and archetypes). I analyze the elementary thinking process and discuss which aspects of this process are available to consciousness. This leads to a suggestion that the mathematical nature of the symbol process is similar to the perception-cognition process. Thus, thinking-process and symbol-process are same: a vortex of emotions, models-archetypes, and sensory data. This vortex brings forth into consciousness the previously unconscious contents of mind, which improve our understanding of the world.},

  volume={11},

  pages={116011-116025},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.},

  abstract={Story Generation through Deep Learning is a fascinating area of research in Artificial Intelligence that aims to create computer systems that can produce original and compelling narratives and is an interesting concept that has flourished in the domain of Machine Learning applications starting from 2018. Most of the research carried out in this specific area has shown advances in Modelling and efficiency of story generation. However, some of the setbacks in Artificial Story Generation include little to no coherency with human generating pattern, tokens/words limitation, missing plot twists and direction of story. In this paper, we have performed a comparative study on Automatic Story Generation as well as the proposed scheme of this paper has main focus on generating a meaningful story with the help of conditional text generation using keywords upto five hundred words by optimizing hugging face generative pre trained model Version Two catering towards the problem of coherency in the text generated. As a result each sentence is semantically coherent and the first three sentences are indeed related to the title itself. The experimental results show a BLEU score of 0.704 averaging over ten genres.},

  title={Novelette, a Usable Visual Storytelling Digital Learning Environment}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={168850-168868},
  abstract={Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.},

  pages={257-264},
  abstract={This paper analyzes the applicability of the task programming model in the parallelization of generic wave front problems. Computations on this type of problems are characterized by a data dependency pattern across a data space, which can produce a variable number of independent tasks through the traversal of such space. Precisely, we think that it is better to formulate the parallelization of this wave front-based programs in terms of logical tasks, instead of threads for several reasons: more efficient matching of computations to available resources, faster start-up and creation task times, improved load balancing and higher level thinking. To implement the parallel wave front we have used two state-of-the art task libraries: TBB and OpenMP 3.0. In this work, we highlight the differences between both implementations, from a programmer standpoint and from the performance point of view. For it, we conduct several experiments to identify the factors that can limit the performance on each case. Besides, we present in the paper a wave front template based on tasks, template that makes easier the coding of parallel wave front codes. We have validated this template with three real dynamic programming algorithms, finding that the TBB-coded template always outperforms the OpenMP based-one.},

  abstract={The primary goal of cognitive computing is to design a digitalized model that is able to mimic human thinking processes. The cognitive engine is in charge of implementing the functionality of a cognitive system. Nowadays, cognitive engines are used as a self-organized management mechanism in different fields such as computer networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics. This is because the management algorithms of these fields are going to be very complex and therefore human thinking models as digitalized models are required for fast and accurate decision making. In this paper, we summarize challenges in designing cognitive engines. Then, a set of challenges in designing the cognitive engine for body-mind operating system in the digitalized healthcare system is obtained. In the literature, our survey and also suggested case study in the healthcare system have not been considered yet.},

  abstract={How can we integrate thinking about ethics and societal implications of technology into computing and engineering education? To have an impact, this kind of thinking needs to be trained and normalized. This can be achieved by integrating such considerations into standard courses taught by faculty, who thereby act as a role model. Yet most faculty feel unprepared to do so, as they do not feel they are experts on this. I argue that we should not rely on coteachers from philosophy and ethics to dare to address such topics. I share my experiences of teaching a “Ubiquitous Computing” course in a computer science context, which not only addresses the human–computer interaction perspective of designing “good experiences” but also fosters students’ reflection on potential negative impacts and on values in design.},

  abstract={In order to study various aspects of students' understanding of atomic orbitals, we have built a 3D virtual environment - "Virtual Water" - to support the learning of some concepts of physics and chemistry at the final high school or first-year university levels. It focuses on the microscopic structure of water and explores, among others, concepts related to atomic and molecular orbitals. To evaluate that software, we have made a qualitative study with 20 first-year students of science and engineering courses at the university of Coimbra, Portugal. Having been asked to describe their views about how they conceive electrons in an atom before seeing "Virtual Water", students revealed some misconceptions. We have tried, with partial success, to overcome them by making students explore our virtual environment.},

  title={Incrementalization of Vertex-Centric Programs}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1019-1029},
  abstract={As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.},

  year={2020},

  pages={1118-1123},
  abstract={Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of "extremeness". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.},

  abstract={Computer science as a discipline encompasses the study and creation of computational techniques for problem-solving. Unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. A considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. This paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. In the proposed architecture, a core lecture is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitation/laboratory sections. The focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. The recitation/laboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. The objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking.},

  abstract={The Black Box is a system with the internal organization and behavior about which the observer has no information. However, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs. The paper is concerned with the implementation of “black box” type of activities to teach computational thinking. The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution. We found out that a lot of the students were not able to think about the concept of the application functioning and were not able to create any formal description of algorithms.},

Using BCI to control a drone will open the way toward smooth and high-response flight. Deep learning is a new-age skill that has made many breakthroughs and influenced modern technologies. It has made it possible to predict and identify even the most complex and abstract patterns that even we humans would be very challenged to catch ourselves. In this paper, a method of controlling a drone using BCI has been presented using an 8-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset.

By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.},

  abstract={This paper represents the progress of an ongoing effort to develop a mobile app called ArtMatch, which will help kids develop a passion for art. The proposed app will deepen children's appreciation for famous pieces of artwork while enhancing their creativity. By taking an image of artwork created by the user, ArtMatch will show the most similar painting done by a famous artist, using AI and deep learning technology. The app works through a program that clusters images based on their design and style. Throughout this process, the user will see the effectiveness of his/her painting through their match with well-known paintings. The program's present version can generate accurate matches for several works done by young children.},

  abstract={A process of data acquisition and analysis of text files for the purpose of following the insurgence and growth of words in the English language is reported. Pitfalls that were encountered and the solutions that were found to these problems are also discussed. The question of whether the Zipf-Mandelbrot law applies to the distribution of words in a language over time is examined. Several other results and future research ideas are discussed.},

  abstract={This study presents a hands-on research experience for an undergraduate junior-level service course, i.e., Circuits and Electromagnetics Devices, for non-Electrical Engineering students and its goal is to demonstrate major research methodologies as well as technical writing principles. The students have learned and investigated scientific research process, literature review sources as well as approaches, technical writing and blind-review principles, and conducted hands-on research on electrical circuit characterization and analysis for an autonomous/electric vehicle operation and a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system operations to investigate the contemporary engineering as well as social trends such as smart/green homes or vehicles. In addition, a practical autonomous vehicle set was utilized to explore the team research outcomes. The final student team outcomes as well as feedback and the corresponding surveys, evaluated by the project administrators, indicate the success of the effective research component inclusion in an undergraduate service course.},

  abstract={Education in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) is affected by substantial current reform efforts. The 3-year multinational project labelled STORIES supports 6th graders’ efforts who normally haven’t yet had any instruction in STEM within regular classroom syllabi. Within a European HORIZON-2020 funding scheme, the consortium of 16 partners of different specialization initiated to develop and sustain a platform for that age-group in order to support young pupils’ collaborative efforts and deeper learning. Consequently, 6th graders of Europe, Japan and the U.S. were collaborating via a platform in planning a virtual trip to the Mars across all science subjects.},
