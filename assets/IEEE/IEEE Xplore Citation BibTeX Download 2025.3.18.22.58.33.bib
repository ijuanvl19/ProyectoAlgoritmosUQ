  abstract={The system aims to direct the user to create their network system collaboratively for a case of Covid-19 health throughout a case study in a Web System and E-Commerce course. The framework of directed health learning is based on 7x2C content knowledge established criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The self-design frame framework is plan-oriented and based on the concept of a plan and plans integrations and special relationships. The user is directed to break the system into plans and the design is to self-guide the user to build a system to comprehend, combat, coexist, cope, and trace COVID-19 with four layers of diagnostics, simulation, and pattern matching database. With the collaboration of users' systems, a fact from one user as output can be transferred to another user as an input in a circulation forming a general fact. Consequently, the transfer of learning from one system flows into another system resulting in a pattern to be found. Based on the pattern an algorithm will formulate to tackle a solution to COVID19. The implication of this study will be a guideline for others to initiate their own participant's system to find a pattern and formulate an algorithm for the pandemic. The idea of self-design and self-directed learning can be transferred to other fields of study covid-19 health. At present time, a parallel case study of goods and services on farming of Sunchoke plant has been directed with three plan themes of Grow, Eat, and Heal.)},

  abstract={Educational robotics provides an interdisciplinary approach to STEM, computer science, and 21stcentury skill acquisition for students of all ages. Robotics can increase student perceptions of STEM subjects as well as foundational skills through an engaging and authentic learning environment. However, the many benefits of robotics for students and teachers are dependent on the curriculum. In this paper we describe how using the Understanding by Design pedagogical framework supports the development of truly integrated and interdisciplinary educational robotics curriculum. Two examples are provided for a virtual robot that showcase this pedagogical approach for combining STEM, art, and programming in an authentic manner.},

  abstract={The advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has driven revolutionary applications like ChatGPT. The widespread use of these applications relies on a mixture of experts (MoE), which contains multiple experts, and selectively engages them for each task to lower operation costs while maintaining performance. Despite MoE, GAI faces challenges in resource consumption when deployed on user devices. Hence, this article proposes mobile edge networks supported MoE-based GAI. We first review the MoE from traditional AI and GAI perspectives, including structure, principles, and applications. We then propose a framework that transfers subtasks to experts in mobile edge networks, aiding GAI model operation on user devices. We discuss challenges in this process and introduce a deep rein-forcement learning-based algorithm to select edge experts for subtask execution. Experimental results show that our framework not only facilitates GAI's deployment on resource-limited devices, but also generates higher-quality content compared to methods without edge network support.},

  year={2023},
  volume={29},
  number={2},
  pages={1463-1477},
  abstract={Spreadsheet-based tools provide a simple yet effective way of calculating values, which makes them the number-one choice for building and formalizing simple models for budget planning and many other applications. A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.},

  abstract={This concept of evolvable, process-oriented modular systems may be viewed as a new business model to sustain European competitiveness in micro and mini assembly. It is clear that this business model implies a high dynamic lifecycle for shop floors. The system will move from a static life cycle since the modules that create the different systems will live beyond the product lifecycle. This dynamicity imposes strong requirements on the way systems are designed, installed, operated, and reengineered. Re-configurability is not enough. These requirements will not only have an impact on the individual control architecture of the modules but also on, and this is very important, how the system is created, and several types of co-existing architectures},

At present, the development of artificial intelligence in various fields is getting better and better, and the artificial intelligence information technology is slowly beginning to converge towards the auditing field. The blockchain storage application system requires each node to store a complete data, causing waste of the storage resources; at the same time, it does not make full use of the network routing traffic resources. Based on this background, this paper proposes the novel AI and BC based intelligent system for the audit internal control. The system is designed and validated through the simulation. The proposed intelligent system can improve the overall efficiency.},

  abstract={The K-12 ICT (Information and Communication Technology) curriculum in Taiwan faced many changes in last two decades. In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.},

  abstract={In present study the fractal theory has been reviewed in the context of bio-functional and biomedical complex systems. The chaotic approach is a critical component of the theoretical framework and can be used in analyzing complex biological structures such as chromatin structures. Fractality is a metric of complexity in biological functions; it is an indicator of the complication level of the self-similar structure, while chaos is a sort of dynamic behavior that usually produces totally arbitrary patterns. Fractal measurements in vivo could be used to predict the efficiency of painful therapy. The fractal technique can be used to assess carcinogenesis, tumor progression, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment with the convergence of modern sensing techniques in nano-scale spectroscopic techniques, which is a prospective biomarker. The mathematical principles of fractals and chaos in biological systems are presented in the context of the condition of health treatment and their significance. Fractality in different biological functions including the heart has now been investigated and measured the dosing quantity with chaos and fractal level. As excessive amounts of chaos and fractal complexity are harmful to biological predictions. For biological applications, chaos analysis may be advantageous. This paper is a review which highlights the fractal and chaos theories for biological functions and biomedical systems. The focus will be to explore biological functions, due to its computational machine learning-based demands and capability in mathematical complexity.},

VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.},

(RQ3) Can CT improve the performance of students in high school? We conducted an analysis between two groups of students with similar profiles belonging to the same population, where the factor CT proficiency is the only feature that distinguishes both groups. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between the performance of evaluated students and their skills of CT developed by computer programming. In addition, we found that students proficient in computer programming have superior performance up to 10.2% in ENEM (National Exam of High School) assessment compared to those with little or no experience level and even better performance 21% in the WASI test problem-solving in students on attending high school.},

  abstract={This research full paper characterizes the literature on academic initiatives to foster computational thinking and programming (CT&P) in Brazilian K-12 education. Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CT&P in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CT&P in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.},

CT involves problem-solving skills based on Computer Science concepts. However, there is no CT formal definition as well as information on how to integrate it with other high school subjects. Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.},

  abstract={This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.},

  abstract={In the past, many investigations focused on the impact of programming skills towards learning computational thinking (CT). However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.},

  abstract={Recent basic studies reveal that novel solutions to fundamental AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the maturity of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. The latest discovery in knowledge science by Wang revealed that the basic unit of knowledge is a binary relation (bir) as that of bit for information and data. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from those of deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by cognitive systems. Fundamental theories and novel technologies for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra and inference algebra.},
