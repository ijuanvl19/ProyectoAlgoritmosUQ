  abstract={Computation is an increasingly essential tool for doing scientific research. It is expected that future engineers will need to engage and understand computing in order to work effectively with computational systems, technologies, and methodologies. Toward this goal, we leverage our previous work with SugarAid v0.2 to allow learners to test their knowledge of computing by applying engineering concepts. Applied concepts include designing multidisciplinary systems including electrical, mechanical, fluidic, and thermal components. Through this method, we expect learners to enhance their computing knowledge by applying their engineering knowledge.},

  pages={1696-1702},
  abstract={In this pilot study we created and evaluated a new version of the TechCheck Computational Thinking (CT) assessment designed specifically for kindergarten students. The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy.},

  abstract={The development of computer science has led to an increase in programming education for younger people. Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.},

  abstract={BlockPy is a block-based program language which has both block-based interface and traditional text-based interface. It fills the gap between block-based programming and language coding. But there is little work that focuses on the Computational Thinking(CT) evaluation of BlockPy programs. In this paper, we design and implement a BlockPy Analysis Tool to assess the CT skills of BlockPy programs automatically. We use Python's built-in AST module to analyse each node in the abstract syntax tree(AST) of each BlockPy program. Then, considering the characteristics of Python language, we propose a new CT Evaluation Criteria based on Scratch Analysis Tool(SAT). Under the guidance of the CT Evaluation Criteria, we propose a detailed scoring program to analyze each node of the program and get the CT score. Experimental results show the superiority of our tool compared with other analysis tools.},

  pages={20-25},
  abstract={This feasibility study investigates the practicality of incorporating Computational Thinking (CT) education into secondary school curricula, aiming to equip students with essential 21st-century skills. The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.},

  abstract={Research studies provide some evidence that computing and education robotics have a positive impact on female students' engagement in Computational Thinking (CT) practices and their self-efficacy for CT. Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms.},

  abstract={ChatGPT has received considerable attention in education, particularly in programming education because of its capabilities in automated code generation and program repairing and scoring. However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.},

  number={},
  pages={153943-153959},
  abstract={The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.},

  abstract={Most efforts to incorporate computational thinking in K-12 education use visual tools (e.g., Scratch) and focus on students in their first grades. Fewer projects investigate the development of computational thinking in students in the last years of school, who usually have not had early formal preparation to acquire these skills. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.},

The research goals were to examine XYZ generations' HOTS variables in the e-learning concept. This research used Structural Equation Model (SEM) and SmartPLS as statistical tools. With the Judgement sampling method, data were collected through an online questionnaire from 184 respondents from April 21–28, 2022, consisting of students and lecturers at 20 universities in Indonesia who also came from various regions in Indonesia. The proposed model has six variables: Learning Environment, Learning Motivation, Peer Interaction, Learning Strategy, Learning Style, HOTS in e-learning concept, and eight hypotheses. All hypotheses have a significant influence.},

  abstract={This research intends to create a virtual laboratory-based student worksheets model on Electrostatic Forces, Fields, and Equipotential Lines to educate students computational thinking. This study was divided into four stages: needs analysis, practicum learning design, student worksheets development, and evaluation. The literature research and field investigations employed in the needs analysis stage are related to the need for virtual laboratories, whereas the practicum learning design stage begins by determining competency criteria and milestones in computational thinking. The decomposition process, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms are all highlighted in the student worksheets development stage. Expert validation and limited trials are used in the evaluation step. Student responses and learning outcomes are classified as good and practicable to be used as a source of learning in learning activities based on the results of the validation.},

  abstract={The inclusion of computational thinking in third-level professional training is an alternative that revolutionize traditional teaching through new paradigms, ICT tools and new platforms such as the one proposed in this paper that describes the development and implementation of a prototype that allows incorporating computational thinking into educational constructivist models, exploiting the capacities and abilities of a global and interconnected society. The prototype was submitted to an evaluation by 120 students of Information Technology (IT) faculty of the Armed Forces University ESPE located in Sangolqua, Ecuador, in the fields: performance and acceptance of the user, obtaining acceptable results about its applicability, usability and adaptation to the training model by competencies of the institution. The research methodology Desing Science Research (DSR), SCRUM as a design methodology and AppGini as a development tool were applied.},

  abstract={Visual programming languages can be used to make computer science more accessible to a broad range of students. The evaluative focus of current research in the area of visual languages for educational purposes primarily aims to better understand motivational benefits as compared to traditional programming languages. Often these visual languages claim to teach students computational thinking concepts; however, although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not always clear what computational thinking concepts students have actually learned. In this paper we attempt to develop a visual semantic evaluation tool for student-created games and simulations that goes towards depicting the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through semantically analyzing a given student's created projects over time, this visual evaluation tool, called the Computational Thinking Pattern (CTP) graph, can possibly indicate the existence of computational thinking transfer from games to science simulations.},
