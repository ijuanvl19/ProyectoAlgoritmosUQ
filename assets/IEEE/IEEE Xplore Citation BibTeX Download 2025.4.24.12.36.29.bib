  abstract={In this paper we introduce the Crayon Co-Create (C2Create) drawing tool as a mixed-initiative design approach for fostering the creativity of young learners. C2Create follows the principles of mixed-initiative iterative design utilizing variants of novelty search for generating abstract drawings that act as a visual disruptor during the creation process. The authoring tool finds a multitude of uses both as a standalone gameful activity and, most importantly, offering abstract visual assets that can form parts of game components across various types of games that can either be shared in a social environment or played.},

  title={The Concept of Sense in the Aspect of the Theory of Algorithms}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={51-55},
  abstract={The article refers to interdisciplinary scientific research in philosophy, information theory and the theory of algorithms. This article presents the results of theoretical studies on the formalization of human intellectual activity in relation to the field of cognitive sciences. The subject of the study is the concept of sense. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.},

  abstract={Organizations normally focus on delivering the product that could earn maximum profit for the client. They do not focus on time, cost and quality. So the resultant product is of poor quality, over budget, over time, poorly satisfies the client’s requirements, and is high in cost. In this research paper, we will use lean concepts in software project management. It will not only remove all the waste in project management but also improve the project’s quality, time, and cost. We will also compare the project management concept with the lean project management concept and how combining these two will give us a perfect idea to increase software quality, reduce time, and deliver faster delivery. The only drawback is that current standards of software project management are not mature enough to adopt lean management to its extent.},

  abstract={Perhaps the easiest way to present the central theme of this article is to ask the following thought question: "how many people would it take to destroy the world?" By "world" in this context, I am referring to humankind. Destroying the world has been a recurring theme in novels and movies for many years. The end of the world is also an element of many religions. However, until this century there was no real belief that mankind could destroy itself. So, for most of human pre-history and history, destruction of the human race would only have been remotely possible through mass murder/suicide. This was hardly a likely prospect. In the 1800's mechanized warfare and massive production and transport of weapons and supplies became possible. This increased the destructive potential of war, but still did not make it a likely mechanism for global self-destruction. It was only in the 1940s and 1950s that we have achieved the means to destroy the world, with the development and massive production of nuclear weapons. However, developing this capability required a very large technological effort, which only resided in the hands of the large governments. Tens of thousands of people, supported by economies of tens of millions, were required to produce this capability.},

  abstract={Women are underrepresented in the field of Computer Science. This project aims to help Secondary School girls develop an insight into the role computers play in society and to learn some of the key skills in computing including computer programming. Exposure to Computer Science, in home or school environments, and encouragement from family and peers are leading factors that influence girls' decisions to pursue careers in Computer Science. Other factors include the girls' perception of their own problem solving ability, an understanding of the diverse applications of Computer Science and related career paths and the potential for positive social impact. This paper describes the design of an after school computing programme, CodePlus, which uses a novel 21st Century learning model. Pre and post questionnaire are being used to explore girls intentions to study CS, their confidence to study CS, perception of CS as a career, gender perception of CS and IT profession and self-efficacy following participation in the CodePlus programme. Preliminary results comparing pre questionnaire results with a male control group highlight differences in how girls see themselves in terms of CS capabilities and their future potential. Initial post questionnaire findings show a significant increase in the participants' perceived programming ability.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The impact of technology on workforce development and socioeconomic prosperity has made K-12 computing engineering and STEM in general a national educational priority. However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.},

  abstract={As part of the 3D printing summer course for undergrads in our university, students were introduced to Autodesk Tinkercad as a design tool for creating and editing 3D models. After a brief period of familiarization with Tinkercad, we presented students with Codeblocks, a tool integrated with Tinkercad that enables the creation of 3D models through programming under the blocks model. To our surprise, students started creating complex and lengthy programs to produce original printable 3D objects. We decided to investigate this level of engagement using a questionnaire to collect opinions and experiences from students and a set of metrics to categorize their programming work. The results obtained are presented in this paper along with our conjectures on the causes of the enthusiasm observed with Codeblocks. Three factors seem to have been key in this case: diversity in the composition of the student group, availability of 3D printers to materialize designs, and a relaxed environment where test and failure were common and acceptable.},

The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills.},

  abstract={Programming is a traditional part of informatics education from Primary to Upper Secondary Education in Slovakia. We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.},

The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032.},

  abstract={The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom.},

  abstract={The global video game industry's revenues reached 7.2 billion in 2007 and over $65 billion in 2012 with projected growth over $80 billion by 2017. As new consoles, PC, and mobile devices penetrate more foreign markets, revenues derived from these devices and software will continue to increase. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design. This degree will give students the skills needed to pursue a career within the game industry and others while developing engineering skills.},

  abstract={In university computer course, character encoding and its processing involves multiple hardware, and the process is relatively complex and mostly invisible, which makes it difficult for students to understand. In this paper, a virtual experiment is proposed to this process. By using Blockly and other tools, students can independently design character encoding and write Blockly code to describe the whole process of character processing. Relying on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology, the whole process of character processing can be visually demonstrated. It enables students to deeply understand the functions of various character encodings and deepens the understanding of binary coding methods.},
