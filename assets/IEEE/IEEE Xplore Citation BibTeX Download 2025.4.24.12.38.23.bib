  abstract={This study aims to investigate Taiwanese EFL college students' perceptions of the potentials of computer games for language learning. The participants are required to play two selected video games, Sid Meier's Pirates and Telltale Sam & Max in the researcher's computer assisted language learning class. To elicit participants' perceptions of computer games, researchers asked them to write a reflection paper after they had played these two games for more than ten hours. The findings show that most students believe that suitable computer games can assist second language learning. The strengths and weaknesses of using computer games in language education are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract={The development of educational games is expensive as educational games are complex programs. Modelling is a known method to handle the complexity of educational games and reduce development cost via automatic code generation. This paper reviews several modelling languages for modelling educational games under the adventure genre. The objective of the review is to assess the coverage of these modelling languages against known adventure genre and flow theory concepts. The assessment result shows that existing modelling languages do not cover all concepts in the adventure genre and flow theory. The effect of not covering these concepts towards game development and game effectiveness as a learning tool are also discussed.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to discover in detail the two-dimensional mental model created by the blind people using touch screen with audio feedback. It is hypothesized that by augmenting a touch screen display with audio feedback, blind user would be able to have two-dimensional perspective in their mental model. If their mental model of a web page is two-dimensional, the blind people should be able to gain an overview of the web pages accurately, which is important for navigation of the web page. This paper discusses an on-going study to elicit mental models from the blind users using diagrammatic epresentation. The study so far revealed that there is a significant difference between performances using screen-reader program and touch-screen display with audio feedback. However, the performance seems to be affected by page complexity.},

  abstract={Now a day's, online reviews has become one of the most important part of any business. Posting reviews online for products bought or services received has become a trendy approach for people to express opinions and sentiments, which is essential for business intelligence, vendors and other interested parties. Social media like Twitter contains rich information about people's preferences. In this paper movie domain is considered for data mining. For dealing the problem of review mining for predicting sales performance, we have used massive collection of online reviews from IMDB along with thoughts of people about movies from Twitter; both are mined and processed by applying various algorithms. Our analysis shows that both Sentiments captured from reviews and tweets have a major impact on the future sales performance of the movie. For the sentiment factor, we have used Sentiment Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (S-PLSA) model it is a probabilistic approach to analyzing the sentiments in reviews and tweets, which provides succinct summary of the sentiment information. The summarization of both reviews and tweets in terms of sentiments along with additional input of the box office collection from IMDB is given to an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model (ARSA) for sales prediction. After that we have done sentiment analysis of online reviews. In sentiment analysis reviews are classified into negative and positive. We used a simple metric P-N ratio to predict the success of movies i.e. Hit, Average, Flop.},

  abstract={This paper introduces trust and unauthorized operation to traditional RBAC model, and proposes a trust and unauthorized operation based RBAC model (TUORBAC model). The model has greatly improved in safety compared to traditional RBAC model. Before user activates the roles, TUORBAC model downgrade the roles of user according to the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation. When the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation is high, we directly downgrade roles of user to the lowest. Otherwise, we calculate the value of trust, and downgrade the roles of user according to the value of trust, finally activate downgrade roles. In addition, the model introduces downgrade roles, which stored downgrade roles of user. If downgrade roles are nonempty, we directly activate downgrade roles without re-judged, which improves the efficiency of the system.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1283-1291},
  abstract={Modeling and simulating a real world scenario is fundamentally an abstraction that takes only part of the given scenario into the model. Furthermore, the level of detail in the model, a.k.a. the resolution, plays an important role in the modeling and simulation process. Finally, the abstraction and resolution of the model determine the fidelity of the modeling and simulation, which becomes the ultimate utility for the model users. While abstraction, resolution and fidelity are the corner stones of the modeling and simulation discipline, they are often casually utilized. Moreover, their interplay is not investigated in-depth with explicit operationalization of the concepts. This article operationalizes the concept of abstraction, resolution, and fidelity by focusing on the aspect of model information. This theoretic investigation answers propositions involving these concepts, i.e. whether or not a higher resolution model has higher fidelity and why, through set theoretic approaches.},

  abstract={The importance of teaching a solid design methodology is well-recognized and is the goal of many software development courses. There is an ongoing debate concerning how to approach the learning and teaching of this skill, i.e., by focusing on “design first” by means of the UML formalism or by “OO programming first”, deferring the development of UML specifications. This work presents a teaching experience and curriculum content where a “design-first” approach was used to teach Object Oriented Design, incrementally interleaved with Object Oriented Programming aimed at implementing the modeled software through laboratory activities. Working in groups allowed the students to improve communication and collaboration skills, and the use of web 2.0 technologies, such as a wiki, allowed for better course management and for the deployment of a project involving all the students. This approach was used in two year-long courses with students who had slightly different backgrounds and dispositions. Also presented are a preliminary analysis of the written examinations and laboratory exercises; an analysis of common errors and student misconceptions and a preliminary quantitative measure of the results.},

  abstract={Facial expression recognition (FER) is the key to understanding human emotions and feelings. It is an active area of research since human thoughts can be collected, processed, and used in customer satisfaction, politics, and medical domains. Automated FER systems had been developed and have been used to recognize humans' emotions but it has been a quite challenging problem in machine learning due to the high intra-class variation. The first models were using known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayes classifier, Fuzzy Techniques, Feature Selection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in their models but still, some limitations affect the accuracy critically such as subjectivity, occlusion, pose, low resolution, scale, illumination variation, etc. The ability of CNN boosts FER accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have emerged as the greatest way to produce the best results in FER in recent years. Various datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models. FER2013, CK+, JAFFE and FERG are some of the most popular datasets. To improve the accuracy of FER models, one dataset or a mix of datasets has been employed. Every dataset includes limitations and issues that have an impact on the model that is trained for it. As a solution to this problem, our state-of-the-art model based on deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network architectures (CNN) with supportive techniques has been implemented. The proposed model achieved 93.7% accuracy with the combination of FER2013 and CK+ datasets for FER2013.},

  abstract={In today's world with ever increasing amount of text assets overloaded on web with digitized libraries, sorting out these documents got developed into a feasible need. Document clustering is an important procedure which consequently sorts out huge number of articles into a modest number of balanced gatherings. Document clustering is making groups of similar documents into number of clusters such that documents within the same group with high similarity values among one another and dissimilar to documents from other clusters. Common applications of document Clustering includes grouping similar news articles, analysis of customer feedback, text mining, duplicate content detection, finding similar documents, search optimization and many more. This lead to utilization of these documents for finding required information in a competent and efficient manner. Document clustering required a measurement for evaluating how surprising two given information are. This dissimilarity is often estimated by using some distance measures, for example, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean distance, etc. In our work, we evaluated and analyzed how effective these measures are in partitioned clustering for text document datasets. In our experiments we have used standard K-means algorithm and our results details on six text documents datasets and five most commonly used distance or similarity measures in text clustering.},

  abstract={The design of object-oriented systems starts with modeling, a process to identify core concepts and their relations. Mainstream modeling techniques can be either informal (white board, CRC cards, etc.) or formal (e.g., UML editors). The former support well the creative modeling process, but their output is difficult to store, process and maintain. The latter reduce these problems, at the expense of creativity and productivity because they are tedious and not trivial to use. We present Cel, a touch- and gesture-based iPad application to rapidly create, manipulate, and store language agnostic object-oriented software models, based on a minimal set of constructs.

  abstract={Software development techniques has been understood and give systematical model used to plan, design, test, implement, verification, validation and control the designing processes for developing an information-based system and satisfied the end-user’s requirements and needs. Human-centred software development, is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving user’s-oriented problems and fulfill the human-centredneeds and provides framework to provides results according to end-user’s requirements. In this paper we analyze the systematic literature reviews (Ss) and mapping studies and covering numerous primary research studies on different aspects of human centred software development(HCSD) exists. Software development has been turned focus from developed the application phase to user’s-oriented application and switched all the development scenario toward the human centred development. In this paper we review the different literature views papers on software development approaches in past and provide the comparative studies between those approaches and in final we provide the objective and proposed research overview.},

  abstract={The authors have experimented with a novel approach to teaching the fundamentals of random processes. Lectures on theoretical material are either omitted or used sparingly after students have studied and worked on their own. Six to eight computer-based exercises utilizing LabVIEW and MATLAB replaced conventional problem assignments. All topics were preceded by one to two weeks with low-weighted thought assignments which stimulated students to be creative in trying to develop solution approaches to practical problems for which they had not yet been given tools. A 30-question survey, answered by 13 undergraduates (out of 19) and 10 graduates, indicated that the teaching concept is basically sound and appreciated, although workload is considered heavy.<>},

  abstract={Quality Engineering Education has been identified as the foremost thrust area in India. The thrust is mainly due to the new establishment/enrichment of various core engineering industry sectors like Automobile, Healthcare, Agriculture, Avionics, Structural, Telecommunication and Mobile Technologies. Currently even though the country graduates a bulk volume of engineers every year, a major composition of this volume is drained to IT service sectors for employment. To enhance the above thrust of the country many engineering education institutions started focusing on quality of the offered education in terms of numerical ability, creativity and design ability of engineers. The Course Outcomes and Programme Specific Outcomes have been designed with the above focus as a guideline. More emphasis on integration of technology into instruction with learner-centric approach is encouraged. Simulation tools as teaching aids will enrich the understanding ability of the learner. In this work the confidence level of the learners to attain the course level objectives through simulation based teaching pedagogy has been explored. The survey records ensure the impact of this innovative instructional design for the desired course outcomes.},
