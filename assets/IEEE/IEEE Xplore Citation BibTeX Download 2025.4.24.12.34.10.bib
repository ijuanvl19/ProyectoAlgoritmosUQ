  abstract={Simulation of biological spiking networks is becoming more relevant in understanding neuronal processes. An increasing proportion of these simulations focuses on large scale modeling efforts. Unfortunately the size of large networks is often limited by both computational power and memory. Computational power constrains both the maximum number of differential equations and the maximum number of spikes that can be processed per unit time. Memory size limits the maximum number of neurons and synapses that can be simulated. To solve for the computational bottleneck, a neuronal simulator is implemented on a CUDA-based General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU). CUDA provides a C-like environment to harness the computational power of specialized video cards from NVIDIA (these cards provide a computational peak power on single precision floats of 1TFLOPS, at least an order of magnitude higher than the fastest CPU). To solve for the memory bottleneck, a just-in-time synapse storing algorithm is implemented requiring only 4 bytes per synapse. Only the synaptic weight is stored, while both post-synaptic contact and delay are recomputed at run-time. This allows a resource shift from memory to computation which fits with the peculiar GPGPU architecture, where an abundance of compute nodes access the memory via a bandwidth-limited bus. Neurons are represented by a single compartment whose activity is modeled by the Izhikevich formalism. Excitatory synapses are plastic and follow both a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and a short term potentiation/depression rule. We are able to simulate networks with up to a million neurons and up to 100 million synapses on a single GPGPU card. Networks of this size cannot be simulated on desktop computers. For smaller networks the speedup obtained is at least of an order of magnitude compared to traditional CPU platform. As an example of possible use of the present work we present preliminary results on the simulation of early stage of the visual pathway. In the retina, Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC) project to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). LGN projects to the cortical area V1. V1 projects back to LGN. The network is represented by 100,000 neurons, 10 million synapses, and 32 different morphological classes with >350 topological projections. Input to the network is provided by current injection in the RGC layer. The RGC layer models midget and parasol ganglion cells (representing 80% of the RGC in primates). Each ganglion type is then subdivided into on- and off-center cells for a total of 4 different types of RGC. Training is performed via natural stimuli while testing is done with vertical and horizontal bars. The network average spiking frequency is within biological limits. Testing performed with both vertical and horizontal bars shows each pattern propagating along the network's anatomical projections. At each stage the pattern is progressively elaborated and modified. In conclusion we present a novel simulator that is fast, synaptically optimized and anatomically accurate. At an additional cost to an available desktop PC of few hundred dollars we think the GPGPU is an ideal platform to simulate large spiking networks.},

  abstract={In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, marked by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and robotics, the role of engineering education stands as a cornerstone of sustainable progress. Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.},

  abstract={The need for more post-secondary students to major and graduate in STEM fields is widely recognized. Students' motivation and strategic self-regulation have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM classes. But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation. Implications for STEM education are discussed.},

For automatic cheque number recognition, a back propagation artificial neural network with single input layer, one hidden layer and single output layer is implemented. The work aimed to analyze the performance of the system by varying the regularization parameter i.e learning rate. Performance of the system is also analyzed using the learning curves to determine whether it has high bias or high variance. From the result of learning curve the optimal training sets required for the accurate recognition is decided. The performance of the system is analyzed by using correct detection which is defined as the ratio of correctly recognized digits to the total number of digits in the test set. The computational complexity for the training of 2094 data set is achieved around 909 seconds.},

  abstract={The world is grappling with a serious problem: many young individuals are taking their own lives. There is also a challenge in understanding the rising trend of this tendency. It is essential to explore the reasons driving people of all ages to consider suicide and find ways to encourage them to choose life instead. In the modern era, social media acts as a crucial platform where people share their thoughts, activities, and emotional states. This has led to the consideration of whether analyzing social media posts could help discern whether individuals are experiencing joy or sadness, particularly to detect levels of sadness that could indicate suicidal thoughts. This paper employs artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze the social media posts of individuals to gauge their mental state, specifically targeting signs that might indicate a risk of suicide. The study has found a high frequency of suicidal thoughts among those who appear depressed on social media. This research investigated the possibility to identify the likelihood of someone contemplating suicidal through their online behavior. This research demonstrates the potential of utilizing social media analysis to identify and support individuals at risk of suicide, providing new insights into recognizing and assessing suicidal thoughts and representing a significant advancement in suicide prevention efforts.},

  pages={5-10},
  abstract={Teaching students how to code in K-12 classrooms is considered as one of the major keys to promoting engineering education in the future, which can potentially enhance the competency and computational skills of students to adhere better learning outcomes in higher education. The success of promoting coding education or integrating it into school curriculum depends on the perceptions of teachers and headmasters in schools, and how well they believe on coding education and prepare for the innovative teaching and learning. In this exploratory research study, it reports the results of a large-scale quantitative questionnaire surveying 42 primary and secondary schools (n = 42) in Hong Kong, where computer programming has not been regulated as a compulsory course in K-12 curriculum. The questionnaire aims to investigate the school belief on coding education and their practical challenges while integrating it into their regular school curriculum. Our results show that there is a trend in the local schools promoting coding education with positive perceptions on teaching and learning. However, teaching challenges are also mentioned in the survey waiting for solutions, such as lack of teachers training and unified curriculum. Therefore, the empirical experiences of these schools have set forth the future research direction in design and implementation of coding education in K-12 classrooms not only in Hong Kong but also in the globe.},

  year={2020},
  volume={28},
  number={10},
  pages={2510-2522},
  abstract={Many real-world decision making (DM) problems present changing contexts in which uncertainty or vagueness appear. Such uncertainty has been often modeled based on the linguistic information by using single linguistic terms. Dealing with linguistic information in DM demands processes of computing with words whose main characteristic is to emulate human beings reasoning processes to obtain linguistic outputs from linguistic inputs. However, often single linguistic terms are limited or do not express properly the expert's knowledge, being necessary to elaborate richer linguistic expressions easy to understand and able to express greater amount of knowledge, as it is the case of the comparative linguistic expressions based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets. Nevertheless, current computational models for comparative linguistic expressions present limitations both from understandability and precision points of view. The 2-tuple linguistic representation model stands out in these aspects because of its accuracy and interpretability dealing with linguistic terms, both related to the use of the symbolic translation, although 2-tuple linguistic values are still limited by the use of single linguistic terms. Therefore, the aim of this article is to present a new fuzzy linguistic representation model for comparative linguistic expressions that takes advantage of the goodness of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model and improve the interpretability and accuracy of the results in computing with words processes, resulting the so-called extended comparative linguistic expressions with symbolic translation. Taking into account the proposed model, a new computing with words approach is presented and then applied to a DM case study to show its performance and advantages in a real case by comparing with other linguistic decision approaches.},

  abstract={A number of statistical or grammatical models of natural language have been proposed over the years. All of them work a little bit; none of them work very well. It is easy to make them do something useful; it is extremely hard to make them do a lot more. This ease of initial success has led a number of people to make extravagant claims about computer processing of natural language. The difficulty of extending the success has led a number of people to make equally extravagant claims about what cannot be done with computing systems in natural language. We believe that much, much, more can be discovered through purely syntactic means (the only ones available to computers at present) than has been demonstrated. We also believe that syntax is not sufficient for any kind of understanding of natural language by computing systems, so that these syntactic studies must be augmented with some notion of semantics that relates the syntax to an interpretive context. This paper will describe some interesting and novel mathematical models that allow us to study the syntactic behavior of natural language to a much greater depth than usual, and show how they lead to some interesting experiments.},

  abstract={In the modern era the world comes nearer to every individual as an IT revolution where all the applications are computerized. As the level of security breaches and frauds of transaction increases, it requires highly secure identification and personal verification technologies. Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition. Experimental tests performed on the ORL and UMIST database achieves a recognition rate of 99 percent, with low computational cost without any pre-processing step.},

  pages={77-84},
  abstract={It has been observed that many networks arising in practice have skewed node degree distributions. Scale-free networks are one well-known class of such networks. Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further, a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS algorithm.},

  year={2022},
  volume={44},
  number={9},
  pages={4776-4792},
  abstract={Saliency detection by human refers to the ability to identify pertinent information using our perceptive and cognitive capabilities. While human perception is attracted by visual stimuli, our cognitive capability is derived from the inspiration of constructing concepts of reasoning. Saliency detection has gained intensive interest with the aim of resembling human ‘perceptual’ system. However, saliency related to human ‘cognition’, particularly the analysis of complex salient regions (‘cogitating’ process), is yet to be fully exploited. We propose to resemble human cognition, coupled with human perception, to improve saliency detection. We recognize saliency in three phases (‘Seeing’ - ‘Perceiving’ - ‘Cogitating), mimicking human's perceptive and cognitive thinking of an image. In our method, ‘Seeing’ phase is related to human perception, and we formulate the ‘Perceiving’ and ‘Cogitating’ phases related to the human cognition systems via deep neural networks (DNNs) to construct a new module (Cognitive Gate) that enhances the DNN features for saliency detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that established DNNs to resemble human cognition for saliency detection. In our experiments, our approach outperformed 17 benchmarking DNN methods on six well-recognized datasets, demonstrating that resembling human cognition improves saliency detection.},

It explains why it is not valid to explain the output of Mamdani or Takagi–Sugeno–Kang rule-based fuzzy systems using IF-THEN rules, and why it is valid to explain the output of such rule-based fuzzy systems as an association of the compound antecedents of a small subset of the original larger set of rules, using a phrase such as “these linguistic antecedents are symptomatic of this output.” Importantly, it provides a novel multi-step approach to obtain such a small subset of rules for three kinds of fuzzy systems, and illustrates it by means of a very comprehensive example. It also explains why the choice for antecedent membership function shapes may be more critical for XAI than before XAI, why linguistic approximation and similarity are essential for XAI, and, it provides a way to estimate the quality of the explanations.},

  abstract={The cognitive models of information representation and the capacity of human memory are fundamental research areas in cognitive informatics, which help to reveal the mechanism and potential of the brain. This paper develops the object-attribute-relation (OAR) model for describing information representation and storage in the brain. According to the OAR model, the human memory and knowledge are represented by relations, i.e. connections of synapses between neurons, rather than by the neurons themselves as the traditional container metaphor described. Based on the OAR model, the memory capacity of the human brain is calculated as in the order of 10/sup 8432/ bits. The determination of the magnitude of human memory capacity is not only theoretically significant in cognitive informatics, but also practically useful to estimate the human potential, as well as the gap between the natural and machine intelligence.},

  title={Hyponymy Graph Model for Word Semantic Similarity Measurement}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={24},
  number={1},
  pages={96-101},
  abstract={Measuring word semantic similarity is a generic problem with a broad range of applications such as ontology mapping, computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Previous approaches to computing word semantic similarity did not consider concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number. This paper introduced Hyponymy graph, and based on which proposed a novel word semantic similarity model. For two words to be compared, we first retrieve their related concepts; then produce lowest common ancestor matrix and distance matrix between concepts; finally calculate distance-based similarity and information-based similarity, which are integrated to get final semantic similarity. The main contribution of our method is that both concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number are taken into account. This similarity measurement more closely fits with human rating and effectively simulates human thinking process. Our experimental results on benchmark dataset M&C and R&G with WordNet2.1 as platform demonstrate roughly 0.9%-1.2% improvements over existing best approaches.},

  abstract={A STEAM-based approach to education is presented that encompasses science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), with the addition of “the Arts” as a means of reversing continuing declines in science, math, and reading scores in U.S. secondary schools and to better prepare future STEAM scholars and professionals. This is despite the significant emphasis U.S. schools have placed on STEM curricula for nearly the past 20 years. The 2014 New York State Department of Labor report states, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has indicated that the United States needs at least one million more STEM workers than is currently available. The report also cites that 75 percent of students who graduate with a STEM-related degree do not take STEM jobs; however, the need for STEM careers is 2.5 times higher than other fields within New York State. A case study of Project Fibonacci® is presented whose approach is one of immersive learning that emphasizes math within a STEAM context, holding focused STEAM educational forums, and establishing centers of excellence in STEAM education. This may offer additional benefits beyond traditional STEM-only approaches. There is an upward trend towards STEAM-focused curricula driven by the decline in academic scores, which provides more challenges for our youth to compete in the global workforce; and recognizing that STEAM builds upon math as the interconnection between the science and art disciplines, thus expanding career opportunities and experience that ensure a well-rounded citizenry. We are rediscovering the need for balancing the cognitive and logical sides of the brain with the creative force to engender an agile, growth-driven nationwide community.},

  abstract={There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.},

  abstract={Scheduling is a crucial task in various real-life situations, including educational institutions where creating a feasible timetable is a complex challenge due to numerous constraints. The educational timetable scheduling problem is NP-hard, making it a difficult problem to solve optimally within reasonable time frames. Traditional methods like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been applied to this problem with varying degrees of success. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatic timetable generation using neural networks trained by genetic algorithms. Our method leverages the strengths of neural networks in pattern recognition and GAs in optimization to effectively handle the constraints and complexities of timetable scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in scheduling accuracy and computational efficiency. We compare the performance of our proposed method with traditional GAs and demonstrate that the neural network approach trained by GAs achieves superior results in terms of speed and solution quality. This research paves the way for more efficient and intelligent scheduling systems in educational environments.},

  abstract={Initial programming education is a topic that con-tinues to spark much debate, as it is an academic field with a notably high rate of student dropouts and failures. The challenge of offering this subject through distance education adds to the complexity, given the need for students to adapt to this mode of teaching and learning, which significantly differs from traditional classroom settings. Multiple studies suggest that students must appropriately develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills for effective learning. Yet, there is a pressing need for further investigation into the impact of non-cognitive skills on student performance, with a particular focus on motivation, which plays an important role in student success. In this sense, considering the specificities of learning programming, the context of distance education, this research aims to understand the factors that can stimulate students' motivation for initial learning of programming, developing a virtual learning environment that promotes student motivation to learn to program and evaluate the environment to identify whether its features have the potential to stimulate student motivation.},
