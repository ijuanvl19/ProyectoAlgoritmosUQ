  abstract={Artificial intelligence is one of the most trending topics in the field of Computer Science which aims to make machines and computers ‘smart’. There are multiple diverse technical and specialized research associated with it. Due to the accelerating rate of technological changes, artificial intelligence has taken over a lot of human jobs and is giving excellent results that are more efficient and effective, than humans. However, a lot of time there has been a concern about the following: will artificial intelligence surpass human intelligence in the near future? Are computers' ever accelerating abilities to outpace human jobs and skills a matter of concern? The different views and myths on the subject have made it even a more than just a topic of discussion. In this research paper, we will study the existing facts and literature to understand the true definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI) by classifying each of its types separately and analyzing the extent of their full capabilities. Later, we will discuss the possibilities if AI eventually can replace human jobs in the market. Finally, we will synthesize and summarize results and findings of why artificial intelligence cannot surpass human intelligence completely in the future.},

  pages={147-152 vol.4},
  abstract={A knowledge management system including viewpoints as an external constraint is proposed for effective research and development (R&D) management. Examples of viewpoints are "matters of concern" (such as the commercialization of research) and "positions" (such as the head of a research centre). The effect of viewpoints as an external constraint (i.e. a computer's guidance as an external constraint concerning the directions of specific viewpoints) is evaluated by an experiment. The results show that the knowledge management system including such viewpoints is effective. The knowledge management system is related to the approach of organizational intelligence (the integration of human and machine intelligence). "Viewpoints as an external constraint" can direct an internal view in organizational intelligence and allows us to grasp the whole creation process, including human and machine intelligence.},

  year={2022},
  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper synthesizes three fundamental challenges within existing frameworks for the ethical regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) identified in recently published literature. These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.},

  abstract={High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is a standard tool to measure the performance of High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC). There are several parameters which can be optimized to maximize performance delivered by HPCC. HPL provides many such parameters for evaluation of performance. P & Q are two such values which determine the distribution pattern of processes for executing HPL. In this paper HPL runs with different values of P and Q have been carried out for three different values of N while keeping the block size (NB) constant. Value of N represents the problem size of task being executed. Results obtained are included in tables and are also depicted in form of graph and are analytically discussed. These results also provide the basis for deeper analytical approaches for HPCC performance evaluations. This critical analysis also reveals that maximum performance is delivered if the task is evenly distributed over all the available cores and nodes in the HPCC.},

  abstract={With the increasing demand of power supply reliability from power users as well as the great impact of natural disasters on power supply reliability, it is of great significance in recent years to improve the efficiency of the emergency repair of the distribution network failure after the disaster and restore the power supply as soon as possible. However, the current analysis of the impact of the external environment on emergency repairs is not in-depth, resulting in its model not being able to fully reflect the actual circumstances of the distribution network emergency repairs under the background of disasters, making the actual feasibility of the strategies developed poorly. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, this paper analyzes the characteristics of multi-fault emergency repairs under disaster conditions compared with those under normal conditions, proposes a dynamic impact model including weather, repair sites, and infrastructure, also establishes a multi-fault emergency repair model of distribution network and optimization model of emergency repair strategy for distribution network. The simulated annealing algorithm (Simulated Annealing Algorithm, SAA) is used to solve the problem, and through horizontal comparison with common swarm intelligence algorithms such as genetic algorithm, it proves the advantages of SAA algorithm in calculation speed and ability to find the optimal solution. According to the actual data, the methods and principles of formulating the best emergency repair strategy for the distribution network under the disaster background are analyzed.},

  pages={419-423},
  abstract={In recent years sentiment analysis has become a very important part of natural language processing. It allows us to automatically understand the sentiments of humans and views present in textual data. Due to its highly accurate information acquisition based on the context, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have become well-known in this field, among several different approaches. The main objective of this research paper is to discuss the modeling, procedure of training, and assessment of the performance of a sentiment analysis BERT model and compare its performance with a probability-based traditional Naive Bayes approach. We try to discover how we can fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis tasks, and examine its several model configurations and different ways for pre-processing data. Moreover, we conduct detailed tests on well-known datasets to evaluate how accurately the model identifies sophisticated feelings in various environments. We try to show the efficacy of the constructed BERT model in accurately figuring out sentiment polarity and understanding the nuances of human-like sentences in text with the help of detailed studies and comparing ours with different present approaches. This research demonstrates how sentiment analysis models based on BERT can extend their applications in several domains by paving the way for natural language processing systems to understand sentiments easily and more accurately.},

  abstract={Natural learners must compute an estimate of future outcomes that follow from a stimulus in continuous time. Widely used reinforcement learning algorithms discretize continuous time and estimate either transition functions from one step to the next (model-based algorithms) or a scalar value of exponentially discounted future reward using the Bellman equation (model-free algorithms). An important drawback of model-based algorithms is that computational cost grows linearly with the amount of time to be simulated. An important drawback of model-free algorithms is the need to select a timescale required for exponential discounting. We present a computational mechanism, developed based on work in psychology and neuroscience, for computing a scale-invariant timeline of future outcomes. This mechanism efficiently computes an estimate of inputs as a function of future time on a logarithmically compressed scale and can be used to generate a scale-invariant power-law-discounted estimate of expected future reward. The representation of future time retains information about what will happen when. The entire timeline can be constructed in a single parallel operation that generates concrete behavioral and neural predictions. This computational mechanism could be incorporated into future reinforcement learning algorithms.},

  abstract={with rapid development in computer science and its application in engineering industry, the teaching course of computer theory is becoming more and more important in modern higher education in many universities. A teaching methodology is discussed in this paper to meet the need for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of course learning for undergraduate who major in engineering rather than computer science. The methodology is a combination method of theoretical teaching and practical experience. The exploration of course content arrangement as well as teaching method is discussed in detail, and design of lab experiment is analyzed in order to improve course learning. The result shows the effectiveness of the methodology through students' performance.},
