  abstract={The deleterious effects of not bringing projects quickly from the laboratory to the market are described, and corporate efforts to cut development time are examined. Many Japanese companies have already wrestled with this problem and moved on to other issues, like their need for basic research. As a result, many US corporations are looking to the Japanese for guidance. This is leading companies to restructure their organizations to encourage open, frequent, and early communication. Launching research projects with technology transfer in view from the start is another approach modeled after the Japanese. Central to Japanese technology transfer is the fact that as a project moves from laboratory to market, the engineers move with it. This is also being tried by some US firms. A less widespread approach to shortening time to market is called concurrent engineering, in which an item is designed concurrently with the processes that would be used to assemble it, manufacture its parts, test it, and repair it in the field. Standardization is also being used to boost researchers' output.<>},

  abstract={Currently, the power sector is characterized by the dispersion of data across different times, spaces, or complexities, as well as difficulties in the unified collection of sample data, leading to significant challenges in obtaining multi-scale fine-tuning samples. In light of this, this paper focuses on the collection and preprocessing of textual data in the power sector and proposes a method for constructing multi-scale fine-tuning samples in the power sector based on the chain of thought. By introducing multi-scale analysis methods, power system data is divided according to different temporal and spatial scales, thereby creating a sample set with hierarchical structure and diversity. This method can adaptively adjust the selection and enhancement strategies of samples based on the characteristics of data at different scales, thus effectively representing and modeling the complex data of the power system and improving the efficiency and accuracy of text data processing in the power sector.},

  pages={492-497},
  abstract={Design rationale (DR) explains the product design decision-making process and the reason behind the decision. Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction. Partial design process of the POGO mechanical system design is taken as an example to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Integral of single variable functions is an important issue in calculus. This problem is widely applied in many fields such as physics, economics, etc. Systems for automatic solving integral problems are necessary tools in education. They support students and teachers in learning and teaching. Current computer algebra systems such as Maple, Mathematica, etc can solve integral problems. However, they output the result only or are limited to give the complete solution. This paper presents a model for representing knowledge about single variable functions and proposes some algorithms for solving integral problem automatically. These algorithms mimic the human way of thinking and produce the solution that explains the calculus process.},

  abstract={In this study, digital game design is analyzed as a team-based knowledge modelling process. In the context of a graduate seminar, the students were organized in teams and were asked to design a serious game. In the early stages of the process, each team had the possibility to engage in a topic suggested by the professor or decide their topic of interest. Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.},

  abstract={Mobile data acquisition technology in the hands of computer-proficient college students provides opportunities to transform electronics laboratory education into a more ubiquitous model. The use of virtual instruments (VIs), handheld data acquisition (DAQ) modules, and supporting portable hardware can (a) encourage students to work outside of the classroom on procedural hands-on learning activities and (b) promote students' higher-level thinking via instructor and student interactions during follow-on meeting times. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program, explores ways to implement this more ubiquitous education model. The project team will (1) develop inexpensive mobile laboratory tools, (2) create new laboratory protocols, (3) assess the impact of these learning experiences, and (4) disseminate these tools and assessment results. This paper focuses on tasks (2) and (3) for four courses in the East Carolina University (ECU) General Engineering program and the Kansas State University (KSU) Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) programs.},

  abstract={This paper presents a case study that explores the successful integration of project-based learning (PBL) in two courses, Biometry and Computer Vision, at the University of -DFBR-. The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={With the evolution of communication technologies, various substantial applications help the human community. Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption. Therefore, the model attains superior security and efficiency.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pedagogical practice for technical high school students for developing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities through Internet of Things technologies. The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.},

  abstract={Open-source research software plays a central role in accelerating advances in science and engineering. Its increasing significance, however, incentivizes malicious actors to attack that software and compromise the systems on which it runs, undermining the free and open exchange of trustworthy research codes. In the world of conventional software development, there has been a shift towards integrating security as early as possible in the development process to guard against malicious activity. Given the potential risks at hand, developers of research software must consider how to do the same across the research software lifecycle. This editorial argues for the need to unite diverse forms of expertise in scientific computing and software security to address these challenges and outlines a roadmap for future work in this space.},

  abstract={In college life, pressure is the main cause of student suicides, highlighting a significant societal and academic challenge that demands urgent attention for early detection systems and support mechanisms. Addressing this issue proactively is crucial. To tackle this, we introduce machine learning models designed to identify suicidal tendencies in students. These models analyze various data points such as depression levels and experiences of discrimination to predict suicide risk levels—high, medium, or low, in the near future. By using predictive analytics, our approach aims to identify those in need so that they can receive the necessary support promptly, thereby reducing the risk of student suicides and promoting a safer, more supportive environment in academic institutions.},

  abstract={The various methods for remote learning has been there in the global education system even from the mid of 90’s. The technology aided online teaching learning process has come to its natural evolution and pace these years. Various technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning etc has made the system very effective and efficient. The technology driven education, be it simple or complex has its own relevance in dealing with certain subjects. By this, subjects can be made interesting,comprehensive and it develops students creativity and imagination. The technology driven education system is not still common because of the mind set of the people, poor connectivity, inadequate technology upgradation in schools. Even though after the advent of the pandemic the use of online tools for education has increased, the suitability of each technology for different age groups is still a matter of concern. Cascading different methods, customizing the technology based on the subject taught is of prime importance. The paper research on various technologies involved in online teaching learning process and try to know the suitability of each technology in different contexts.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.},

  abstract={In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.},

The paper also presents a novel recursive algorithm for efficient computation of CLD for jump controlled structures and another algorithm to defeat the complexity induced due to high deletion rates.},

  abstract={Every society has its own characteristics, shaped from time to time by the various innovative, disruptive, but in any case, dynamically changing mechanisms that affect it most. In today's society, technological innovation plays a major role in the development of individuals and their abilities. Education is the most typical and obvious arena for shaping, developing, and preparing for the challenges of the future. As in the leading sectors, in the world of education, rapid responses and immediate reactions to change significantly increase the ability to achieve and maintain success and thus marketability. As a sector responsible for developing the competences of individuals, building knowledge and training professionals, education should seek to keep pace with trends and break with traditional approaches and methods, so that, in addition to incorporating technological developments, a renewed approach to organizational development and methodology is an important means of achieving the desired success and effectiveness. In the course of our work, we provide a summary insight into the project work of student groups who require up-to-date IT skills, use advanced IT tools, plan, and implement their web development workflows supported by database management, front-end planning and design, and back-end programming with a project management approach according to the latest trends, interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of working methods for success.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made remarkable advances across various domains, capturing the interest of researchers, also in the fields of signal processing and speech enhancement (SE). This growing of attention has led to numerous studies focusing on developing and improving models for SE. One of the persistent challenges in the area is in designing a lightweight model (in terms of memory and computation requirements) that still delivers satisfactory results in terms of sound quality. In this paper, we present a lightweight, DNN-based SE model that offers significantly less computations than the current state-of-the-art SE models. By following a step-by-step approach, we re-evaluate the impact of various parts of typical SE models revealing the trade-offs between speech quality and computational costs. Assuming a single-core, 200MHz microcontroller device, our SE model can achieve real-time SE performance (less than 3M Multiply-Accumulate operations, MACs) with a small degradation in SE capabilities compared to state-of-the-art SE models.},

  abstract={Its use in literary criticism might be one of the most novel opportunities to analyze texts and themes since artificial intelligence (AI) touches and improves every facet of human life. This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but evaluating their quality remains an open challenge. Existing automated metrics like FID are unable to fully capture generation performance across both objective fidelity and subjective aesthetic attributes important to human perception. This paper conducts an extensive review of the literature on GAN evaluation methodology. Key limitations of current approaches are analyzed through a discussion of popular metrics and their inability to predict human judgment comprehensively. To address this, a novel hybrid evaluation model is proposed that combines automated scores with human ratings to provide a more balanced assessment. A pilot study demonstrates the hybrid metric can predict human response more accurately.},
