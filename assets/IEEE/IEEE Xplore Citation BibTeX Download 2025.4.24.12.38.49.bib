  abstract={The ABET engineering criteria was first formulated and introduced to the American education system in the middle 1990s. The ABET accreditation system defines an engineering graduate according to Blooms Taxonomy. As a part of the continuing curriculum improvement at Bucknell University, a new junior-level design course has been recently introduced into the curriculum. The course title is ECEG 301: Praxis for Engineering Design. The objectives of this course are manifold, but is primarily designed to pave the way to improved student performance in senior design projects, promote team-work and hands-on experiences, and to enhance student completion of ABET outcomes, particularly criteria (c to h). Examples of the course contents include computer aided design (Solidworks®), 3-D printing, design process elements, functional decomposition, fabrication, implementation, and simulation of photovoltaic systems. The course also aims at introducing students to crucial and current societal and environmental issues. In this paper, the results of the multiple projects are discussed. Based on anecdotal data analysis and feedback from students and faculty, the assigned projects have encouraged students' creativity and enhanced their ability to work on multidisciplinary teams. The inclusion of similar courses in undergraduate engineering curriculum would definitely improve students' hands on experiences and prepare them for more complex design challenges.},

  abstract={In this paper we propose a model of e-university, where teaching and learning processes are formalized. In this model we appeal to the following two types of games: reflexive games and computer-based problem-solving games. These games are used for seminars and assessments. Reflexive games play a crucial role in grouping courses into one curriculum. Hence, e-university is proposed to be organized by means of the so-called reflexive management.},

Topological plots of time-averaged EEG signals across all the trials corresponding to the imagery of a particular word are fed as input to the designed deep neural network algorithm. Designed deep learning architecture has an amalgamation of the Two-dimensional convolutional neural network and LSTM that takes the assistance of the capabilities and assets of both neural network architectures. The proposed neural network architecture achieves admirable accuracy in identifying imagined words from the EEG-based Kara one dataset. The accuracy of the designed CNN-LSTM model with topological plots as input features was 20-25% more than chance level accuracy and comparable to the state of arts.},

  abstract={Implementation of the new paradigm product lifecycle management (PLM) essentially changed work of engineers. At the same time, engineering with multidisciplinary products demanded PLM. PLM brought experience and expertise based knowledge driven product representation. It integrated huge amount information about product objects, processes, activities, analyses, methodologies, equipment, devices, and communications in active knowledge driven complex model. This model supposed advanced computer system. Currently, inherent characteristics of PLM modeling give new chance for higher education to turn towards case study and project based course programs while save theoretical content. In this paper, analysis and explanation of the new world of virtual engineering is introduced and discussed in order to conceptualize a future vision of higher education in engineering. Main contribution of this paper is practice oriented concept and model of course where theory and practice is harmonized in integrated teaching content using advanced PLM environment. Affect of PLM on curriculum is other main issue in this contribution.},

  abstract={Many conflicts emanate from failure to understand others’ perspectives. Computationally supported roleplaying games have the potential to promote successful perspective taking. When implemented with the affordances of virtual reality, nuances of embodied communication in roleplaying can be more robustly modeled. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a roleplaying game aimed at simulating ingroup-outgroup biases with the goal of supporting positive perspective taking in virtual reality: On the Plane. The game presents players with a simulation of air travel experience, from airport security screening to in-flight events. On the Plane affords the ability to experience the simulation as different characters, supporting both ingroup and outgroup perspectives. We describe how the game is structured to simulate and challenge ingroupoutgroup biases within the context of xenophobia and lay out our plans for future research using On the Plane to promote positive perspective transformation (e.g., challenging one’s own ill-founded preconceptions).},

  abstract={Cyberbullying, the act of intentionally causing harm to others through electronic communication, has emerged as a critical societal concern, particularly among university students. With the rapid proliferation of digital technologies, university campuses have become hotspots for cyberbullying incidents, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors driving this phenomenon. This paper presents a systematic review that aims to identify and analyze the key factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The conceptual framework that was utilized to pinpoint the factors influencing university students' cyberbullying behaviours was examined in this study. According to a systematic screening of recent research articles (from 2013 to 2023) pertaining to online bullying behaviours among university students, the findings were given. After evaluating theoretical models and associated concepts, we suggest using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to evaluate factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The findings of this study are discussed, and it is concluded that subjective norms, attitude, perceived behavioural control, social media use, and intentions all have the ability to influence university students' cyberbullying behaviours.},

  abstract={Image captioning stands as a pivotal technique for providing contextual descriptions of visual content, promising substantial enhancement in the capabilities of conversational AI systems. This work delves into the integration of image captioning methodologies into ChatGPT, aiming to fortify its capacity in understanding and responding to visual information. The study extensively explores the application of deep learning models, encompassing ResNet50, LSTM, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2, in the domain of image captioning. Specifically, a comprehensive investigation is conducted into a Recurrent Neural Network employing LSTM as a decoder and a Convolutional Neural Network utilizing ResNet as an encoder. These fusion harnesses vocabulary and image features to craft precise and meaningful descriptions of visual content. Furthermore, this study pioneers an approach to identify and relate at least two salient features within any given image, forming a coherent caption that binds the relationship between these identified features. This novel capability not only refines image captioning techniques but also empowers ChatGPT to comprehend complex visual contexts within conversational settings. The outcomes of this work offer profound insights into augmenting AI capabilities, facilitating a deeper understanding and more effective interaction with visual information across various domains, thereby advancing the field of conversational AI integration with visual context.},

  abstract={Game-based learning or educational games has a constantly positive impact on learners while offering a variety of knowledge presentations and providing multiple opportunities to be applied during learning process. The development of an effective educational game has been a challenge for game developers to understand the depth and relationships between game play (rules and regulations), game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter (subject content, learners, teachers) embedded in the educational game. Thus, the authors have proposed a multi-domain framework with extracted implicit vaguely supported relationships through a systematic literature review. These relationships are verified through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts to validate the relationships. This paper presents seven (7) implicit relationships based on game play domain and discusses their relevancy with game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach of qualitative study. Consequently, this paper concludes seven (7) explicit relationships in perspective of game play for game developers to reflect on during the development process of educational games.},

In spite of the phenomenal growth of MOOCs, people in the Majority World fail to take advantage of them due to several challenges that include the cultural relevance of courses, differences in teaching and learning pedagogy, language barriers, and most tangibly, lack of sufficient telecommunication infrastructure. To address these challenges and maximize the potential of MOOCs for expanding access to higher education, a 2-year pilot program was launched in 2015 in an impoverished area of Nairobi, Kenya to explore a new learning modality combining quality online materials and in-class meetings with learning facilitators. This paper discusses the potential of such a model to scale beyond the initial pilot to make higher education accessible to those with the least access.},

  abstract={Integration of all engineering related information in a single complex product model is one of the main purposes in computer system based engineering activities. Because engineering process highly depends on product development and application projects, its definition was first realized in product modeling environments at the application of product data management (PDM) systems. However, this administrative solution could not be integrated with the content of product descriptions. As a contribution to efforts for integration of engineering process definitions in product model, work in a recent research project theoretically grounded the definition of engineering process entities and their connections with product model entities. The author of this paper participated at that project and considered practical points of view in order to reveal possibilities for the implementation of the proposed method in industrial product modeling environments. This paper introduces an analysis on the role of product model in engineering process and characteristics of processes for engineering process definition. Following this, it discusses definition, integration, coordination, content, product, and background related resources of engineering process definition in product model.},

The learning system consists of a network simulation platform, an inquiry-based teaching plan and a set of network simulation model. The paper presents that how the design of the learning system motivates the students, reduces the abstract of the content of course and saves the cost of teaching instruments.},

  abstract={The education of students in Medical and Nursing Schools is a prime candidate to benefit from the promises of simulation-based learning tools. Well designed computer based systems have been shown to have a dramatic impact on the learning of students. At the same time, the design of these learning tools is still a pain staking task. In this paper, we share our experience at developing and testing a game-based environment for training nursing students.},

  abstract={The authors' study of how the brain controls so many muscles has suggested that actions inherit structure from protypical action schemas. This suggestion is convergent with the independent conclusions of some linguists that the authors' basic concepts derive from prototypical sensorimotor schemas. To study the common ideas, the authors combine a simulation of schemas in early Piagetian development with a simulated Adventure game protagonist who sees the world only in terms of force, balance, containment, and other schemas and affects that seem to underlie both movement and language. It is expected that neural networks will learn better when fed the responses of these schemas in addition to sensory inputs.<>},
