  abstract={Complex networks undergird everything from social media interactions to biological processes; therefore, uncovering their concealed patterns is more crucial than ever in today's digital world. The proposed work investigates graph mining techniques, emphasizing Frequent Subgraph Mining, to identify recurring themes and relationships in complex networks. The proposed study investigates in depth the relationship between graph representation, node and edge attributes, and network metrics, enabling analysts to evaluate a wide variety of data easily. Examining the applicability of Frequent Subgraph Mining in numerous contexts, ranging from social networks to biological systems, facilitates decision-making and inspires originality. The results demonstrate that these techniques are useful for identifying patterns and are computationally efficient, making them indispensable instruments for understanding the digital foundations of complex networks.},

  abstract={In this work, we present a line of research focus on the didactics of teaching and learning of Computer Science for primary school. Our approach combines the training of teachers in Computational Thinking with Unplugged activities (without the use of computer) and Plugged ones, involving programming of computers and other devices. As a first instance of training, we presents the design and implementation of the "Higher Level Teaching Specialization in Didactics of Computer Science", approved by the Educational Ministry of Santa Fe, Argentine. The objective of this specialization is that the primary teachers can appropriate of Computational Thinking skills and the potential of programming, to include them in their educational practices in a contextualized, interdisciplinary and inclusive way. As results, an opinion poll is presented on a first stage of this training, from which it is possible to extract positive opinions of the teachers regarding the contents and didactics of the specialization that they are carrying out.},

  abstract={Digital technology, tools, and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been an emerging trend in the design industry for the past two decades. AI is one of the latest computational technology that can mimic human intelligence and is dominating the IT industry at present. A lot of intelligent minds have connected to creating and building more smart and efficient ways of working and distributing creativeness along with the designers and their clients. They are generating the benefits such as design iterations, application of materials and their visualization, optimization of consumed time on projects, and management of information and resources. The area wherein the consumer benefits are within the product or material availabilities, and the reality of their visual perception and personalization within any space. It creates ample ideas based on personal needs and functions. This process consumes less time and makes way for better precision in the construction process with the compatibility of the tools and applications with the production mechanisms. The project working happening beyond 2 dimensions & 3 dimensions with 5D & 6D as in BIM working on multi-dimensional function with real-time extraction of information demonstrating changes in appearance, cost, and work scheduling. Being such a complex phenomenon, these need to be continuously studied as per contextual demands. This study is an assessment and analysis of the utility of these applications in built spaces by different stakeholders and changes in the design-build delivery process. These can benefit and profit designers in ways that can make their work efficient and expand their prolific enhancements in interiors that everyone can use for future studies in the longer run.},

  pages={1:1-1:11},
  abstract={Creative problems are ill-defined, and thus experimentation, evaluation, and iteration are key elements of creative problem solving. We present a computational theory of evaluation in creative design. Our technique evaluates a design concept by analogically comparing it with alternative articulations of the concept. We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC). We evaluate DESC through computational experimentation across several models to illustrate its strengths and limits and to highlight areas for future research.},

  abstract={Humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.},

  abstract={This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},

  abstract={Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience in teaching an introductory programming course in Python by using a visual programming development environment based on flow-charts and active learning with an interactive eBook. The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.},

  abstract={This article presents a course that relates environmental education and the development of STEAM skills through the valorization of WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment). As a didactic tool, the BEAM Robots are used, which are simple robots that can be built with elements extracted from WEEE. For the execution of the course, a four-phase curriculum design is developed: propaedeutics, assembly, Computational Thinking (CT), and WEEE. The course is built in a modular way and implemented virtually. The students were evaluated with pre and post-surveys, to investigate the impact of the course. In addition, evaluation activities were created that made it possible to follow the development of the students. In general, it can be concluded that the course had a positive impact on students' STEAM skills and knowledge, as well as an improvement in environmental awareness related to the creative reuse of WEEE.},

  abstract={There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively.},

  abstract={As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.},

  abstract={In most of e-commerce site, evaluation systems are employed to evaluate each user after the tradings. Normally, seller's evaluation score is shown in e-commerce site that is computed based on score given by buyers. In recent e-commerce site, the evaluation is based on multiple attributes and buyers give their thinking for each attribute. In this viewpoint, the seller evaluation in e-commerce is collected knowledge from buyers and synthetic score is computational intelligence because each buyer makes his/her decision whether he/she trades with the seller. In this paper, we discuss the computational intelligence of evaluation system in e-commerce. Then, to avoid asymmetric and incomplete information in tradings, we design a mechanism of trader evaluation. After that, we give some experiments to show the rate of successful trade in our proposed mechanism. Contributions of this paper are showing theoretical discussion of e-commerce computational intelligence, design on evaluation mechanism and showing the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract={Arguably the grand goal of artificial intelligence research is to produce machines with general intelligence: the capacity to solve multiple problems, not just one. Artificial intelligence (AI) has investigated the general intelligence capacity of machines within the domain of games more than any other domain given the ideal properties of games for that purpose: controlled yet interesting and computationally hard problems. This line of research, however, has so far focused solely on one specific way of which intelligence can be applied to games: playing them. In this paper, we build on the general game-playing paradigm and expand it to cater for all core AI tasks within a game design process. That includes general player experience and behavior modeling, general non-player character behavior, general AI-assisted tools, general level generation and complete game generation. The new scope for general general game AI beyond game-playing broadens the applicability and capacity of AI algorithms and our understanding of intelligence as tested in a creative domain that interweaves problem solving, art, and engineering.},

  abstract={This paper presents a structural organization of declarative memories using a new model of spiking neurons. Using this model we propose a self-organizing mechanism to build episodic and semantic memories on the cognitive level. Neurons in this approach represent symbolic concepts that are stored and associated with each other based on the observed events in the environment. We demonstrate that the associative neuron and their synaptic connections yield memories that are capable to recognize sequences of events and therefore can be a foundation for episodic memories. We also demonstrate that semantic memories build using these neuron models are capable to store the knowledge and respond in a novel, creative way to input stimuli. The paper presents the developed associative neuron model, neural network organization that results from input sequences, and simulation results.},

  title={Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, ‚Äúmoderately ill-structured problems‚Äù are defined as a category of problems specified by ‚Äúwell-structured domain model‚Äù and ‚Äúill-structured problem setting‚Äù. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as ‚Äúproblem-posing assignment‚Äù based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.},

  pages={301-305 vol.1},
  abstract={As the classroom paradigm shifts from being teacher-centered to being learner-centered, student assessments are evolving from paper-and-pencil testing to other methods of evaluation. Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program. This paper discusses the methods of assessment used and the results.},

  abstract={The increasing interest in understanding the behavior of biological neural networks, and the expanding utilization of artificial neural networks in different fields and scales, both require a thorough understanding of how technological computing works. However, von Neumann in his classic "First Draft" warned that it would be unsound to use his suggested paradigm to model neural operation, furthermore that using "too fast" processors vitiates his paradigm, which was intended only to describe (the timing relations of) vacuum tubes. Thus, it is worth scrutinizing how the present technology solutions can be used to mimic biology. Some electronic components bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining them using different principles can result in systems with inferior efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional computing principles, components, and thinking about computing limit mimicking biological systems.},

In this paper, we tried to introduce a new biological environment for information retrieval that broad the modeling concept from the mathematical formula that simulates the basic elements of IR problem to their dual schemas in biology. It's a new way of thinking of, and dealing with, the problem of information retrieval.},

  abstract={Programming has emerged as a crucial educational skill, as its acquisition correlates with the enhancement of students‚Äô reading, writing, creative, computational, and problem-solving aptitudes. This significance is particularly pronounced in a global landscape transitioning into the 4.0 era, characterized by pervasive information technology integration into daily life. This research endeavors to explore the potential of utilizing board games for coding education, specifically targeting student demographics lacking access to modern technology and educational resources, such as ethnic groups or remote populations distanced from urban centers. The board game‚Äôs efficacy in augmenting programming comprehension was evaluated through testing and feedback solicited from students and teachers in schools across Chiang Rai Province. Moreover, insights from computer science educators were incorporated to refine gameplay and enrich knowledge components, ensuring adaptability and applicability for future educational contexts.},

  abstract={John Clark was inventor of the Eureka machine to generate hexameter Latin verse. He labored for 13 years from 1832 to implement the device that could compose at random over 26 million different lines of well-formed verse. This article proposes that Clark should be regarded as an early cognitive scientist. Clark described his machine as an illustration of a theory of ‚Äúkaleidoscopic evolution‚Äù whereby the Latin verse is ‚Äúconceived in the mind of the machine‚Äù then mechanically produced and displayed. We describe the background to automated generation of verse, the design and mechanics of Eureka, its reception in London in 1845 and its place in the history of language generation by machine. The article interprets Clark's theory of kaleidoscopic evolution in terms of modern cognitive science. It suggests that Clark has not been given the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of computational creativity.},

  abstract={As part of a national strategic plan recently established by the Ministry of Education in Israel to strengthen science and technology education, an innovative Computer Science (CS) curriculum for middle school was developed. One main goal of the new curriculum is to expose students at an early stage of education to the fundamentals of CS and computational thinking, and to encourage students to study CS in the future. We present the curriculum and its initial implementation, focusing on issues of teachers' professional development.},

  abstract={EarSketch lowers the barriers to entry and broadens engagement in computer science through expressive and culturally relevant music composition. In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.},

  abstract={In patient monitoring fuzzy-based evaluation can be used advantageously, because of its characteristics. This approach can work with input factors, for which sharp limits cannot be defined and it can handle uncertainties, subjectivity in the data as well as the evaluation process. The conventional Mamdani inference is the most suitable method, because it helps to build a model, which is much closer to human thinking, but its computational needs are very high, due to the complex-shape functions. This paper introduces a flexible patient monitoring system optimization, where the input functions can be tuned according to the personal statistics. Modified versions of the Mamdani inference are applied in this system, which can reduce computational complexity, while they retain the advantages of the original method.},

  abstract={This paper describes an approach utilizing both data analysis and visualization to help diabetes patients improve medication compliance. Through information visualization tools, we aim to provide feedback to patients to encourage behavior change. The system has two core building blocks: (1) Data analysis combining several statistical and machine learning models, founded under different principles and assumptions, into a single meta-model for predicting compliance behavior. The aim is to create superior models for behavior prediction - knowledge that can then be translated into patient-centered decision-support tools. (2) Incorporating data analysis and visualization enabling datasets to be turned into knowledge utilities that can intelligently interact with participants by alerting them to any interesting correlations within the data. Such tools could provide feedback indicating, for example, a high-risk to medication non-compliance behavior in which case appropriate resources could be directed to those who need help the most.},
