  abstract={The Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs (CPACE) team developed a partnership among various stakeholders to identify the computational skills that are essential for a globally competitive engineering workforce. Our goal is to redesign the role of computing within the engineering programs at Michigan State University (MSU) and Lansing Community College (LCC) to develop computational competencies - informed by industry needs - by infusing computational learning opportunities into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. In this paper we summarize the process that we used to translate our research findings about the computational competencies needs in the engineering workplace into fundamental computer science (CS) concepts that can be used in curricular implementation. We also discuss the initial phase of our curricular implementation strategy in two disciplinary engineering programs at MSU and transfer programs at LCC.},

  year={2004},
  volume={20},
  number={1},
  pages={52-62},
  abstract={This article constitutes an effort to gain insights into the nature of creativity and its mechanisms leading to creative solutions to problems. This article claims that reflection constitutes the underlying mechanism, serving as a catalyst for creativity. A total of five experiments is presented, incurred in industrial and academic research environments and pedagogical settings, that demonstrate the occurrence of creativity, deliberately triggered by reflection. The key contribution of this article is that, although the exact definition of creativity continues to elude us, two mechanisms have been uncovered that are potentially useful in triggering creativity, at will, in ordinary scientific and engineering personnel to achieve quantum leaps in our knowledge and achievement. Reflection plays a key, catalytic role in both of these mechanisms and also appears to underlie the inner workings of Nature.},

  year={2023},
  volume={15},
  number={3},
  pages={1170-1182},
  abstract={From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large "linguistic receptive fields." Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.},

  abstract={According to Henry Jenkins, Transmedia storytelling is defined as "Transmedia storytelling (TMS) represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story." (Jenkins 2007) In recent years, this technique is becoming popular in Europe and America. A creator needs to combine "Flow of story" and "Story experience" at a stage of planning a TMS project. Also, it is hard to build an elaborate plan; the world view of the story, time base, and how to invite the audience to participate in the experience. In this study, we propose the method of visualizing a structure of the entire story with a possible tree-structure model assumed from content elements that users are thinking about when they start to work on a TMS project.},

  abstract={In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.},

  abstract={In the competitive economy of the 21st century, innovation and the attitude to innovation are key factors. The depletion of traditional natural resources in today’s fast-changing world has virtually eliminated the former engine of economic growth, and a new approach is needed to enable economic actors to cope with the new environment. New solutions are the only way to overcome the anomaly of natural resources. It is essential that all economic actors, from micro to large enterprises, can play their part in this process. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the conditions are created in the near future to promote and stimulate innovation. The aim of this study is to present the Hungarian SME sector’s view on the factors that stimulate innovation, assessing the potential characteristics that can contribute to these processes and behaviours.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for better communication between collaborating engineers and between engineer and entity generation processes at the definition of products in modeling systems. The authors recognized the importance of correct human-computer- human communication by using of product model as a special medium for engineers. In order to establish a product model that is appropriate for this purpose, they integrated all influencing effects on a product in an influencing space. In order to record content of influencing by engineers and other influencing persons, authorities, etc., the currently prevailing information based product model is completed by representation of information content. This paper emphasizes some relevant issues of information content. Definition of this contents starts from modeling of human intent. Intent model is consists of information about the owner of an intent, characteristics of that intent, and representation of content of intent in some form of knowledge. Information content is organized in the interconnected intent, behavior, and decision spaces. In a hierarchical system, intent space is at the highest and decision space is at the lowest level hierarchy assuring human intent based automation of decision making on engineering object in an improved product model.},

  abstract={Advanced engineering applies model space for the development complete and consistent description of product objects and structures. Description of parts and units of products have been completed by related objects such as results of analyses, interacting humans, equipment control programs, rules, and so on. Humans define these objects by using of contextual connections. Considering current product modeling, the next step of development is application of achievements from the area of intelligent computing at the definition of engineering objects in product models. This paper introduces a method for the application of knowledge based decision making in order to replace the conventional direct definition of engineering objects in model based product development. The authors developed a new modeling method on the basis of their earlier proposed concept of information content. In this paper, they introduce this modeling method and detail its application in the form of an extension to the classical model space that is suitable for control of engineering object definition through a contextual chain starting from influencing humans.},

Through examples, the effectiveness of these dialogue and reasoning methods is demonstrated. An interesting observation is made that when the task's goal and user intent are conveyed to GPT-3 via ChatGPT before the start of a dialogue, the large language model seems to connect to the external context expressed in the intent and perform more effectively.},

  abstract={Simulating real-world experiences in a safe environment has made virtual human medical simulations a common use case for research and interpersonal communication training. Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.},

  abstract={Digital technology, tools, and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been an emerging trend in the design industry for the past two decades. AI is one of the latest computational technology that can mimic human intelligence and is dominating the IT industry at present. A lot of intelligent minds have connected to creating and building more smart and efficient ways of working and distributing creativeness along with the designers and their clients. They are generating the benefits such as design iterations, application of materials and their visualization, optimization of consumed time on projects, and management of information and resources. The area wherein the consumer benefits are within the product or material availabilities, and the reality of their visual perception and personalization within any space. It creates ample ideas based on personal needs and functions. This process consumes less time and makes way for better precision in the construction process with the compatibility of the tools and applications with the production mechanisms. The project working happening beyond 2 dimensions & 3 dimensions with 5D & 6D as in BIM working on multi-dimensional function with real-time extraction of information demonstrating changes in appearance, cost, and work scheduling. Being such a complex phenomenon, these need to be continuously studied as per contextual demands. This study is an assessment and analysis of the utility of these applications in built spaces by different stakeholders and changes in the design-build delivery process. These can benefit and profit designers in ways that can make their work efficient and expand their prolific enhancements in interiors that everyone can use for future studies in the longer run.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={This article emphasizes an interesting approach to synthesize computational creativity by a process similar to deductive reasoning with a provision for testing the degree of diversity of the generated instances compared to their predecessors. The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics. The proposed algorithms have successfully been employed in developing chapter-end exercises for trigonometric identity proving problems.},

  abstract={Creative problems are ill-defined, and thus experimentation, evaluation, and iteration are key elements of creative problem solving. We present a computational theory of evaluation in creative design. Our technique evaluates a design concept by analogically comparing it with alternative articulations of the concept. We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC). We evaluate DESC through computational experimentation across several models to illustrate its strengths and limits and to highlight areas for future research.},

As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.},

  abstract={This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},

  abstract={Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience in teaching an introductory programming course in Python by using a visual programming development environment based on flow-charts and active learning with an interactive eBook. The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.},

  abstract={This article presents a course that relates environmental education and the development of STEAM skills through the valorization of WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment). As a didactic tool, the BEAM Robots are used, which are simple robots that can be built with elements extracted from WEEE. For the execution of the course, a four-phase curriculum design is developed: propaedeutics, assembly, Computational Thinking (CT), and WEEE. The course is built in a modular way and implemented virtually. The students were evaluated with pre and post-surveys, to investigate the impact of the course. In addition, evaluation activities were created that made it possible to follow the development of the students. In general, it can be concluded that the course had a positive impact on students' STEAM skills and knowledge, as well as an improvement in environmental awareness related to the creative reuse of WEEE.},
