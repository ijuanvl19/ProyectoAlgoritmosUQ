  abstract={This paper meticulously examines the escalating impact of AI Generative Tools on academic assessments and suggests renovating strategies to uphold the integrity of educational evaluations. With the increasing prevalence of AI-assisted cheating, traditional assessment methods encounter unprecedented challenges, prompting a fundamental shift in educational practices. The paper navigates the proliferation of AI Generative Tools, inspecting their diverse forms and motivations while addressing the ethical dilemmas arising from their integration into academic settings. Recognizing the constraints of current plagiarism detection tools, the paper explores innovative approaches to mitigate AI influence, emphasizing educational awareness programs, unambiguous academic integrity policies, and advancements in detection technologies. Advocating a departure from conventional assessment paradigms, the paper proposes the adoption of randomized questions, live assessments, and competency-based evaluations. Additionally, it recommends collaborative and authentic assessments to foster teamwork, communication, and the real-world application of knowledge. The paper delves into the necessity for updated policies, underscoring the enforcement of academic integrity and highlighting the significance of faculty development programs to empower educators in addressing AI-assisted cheating. The conclusion underscores the imperative for educational institutions to adapt proactively, providing practical insights and issuing a call to action in response to the dynamic challenges posed by AI.},

  abstract={The motivation for this work stems from the falling enrollments in the computing discipline and the subsequent challenge to present the study of computing in a manner that is attractive to a wider range of potential students. This paper seeks to capture a new notion of "curriculum models" and to draw attention to the range of possible approaches programs might adopt. This paper addresses issues that may underpin some of this transformational process. It mentions some of the underlying assumptions regarding the situation and explores the affect of curricula reports in computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information technology, and software engineering as published by ACM and the computer society of IEEE. (Both authors have co-authored some of these documents.) From these reports, the paper explores the framework of new curricula models based on broad strategies for creating or developing a curriculum from organization and orientation points of view. Considerations for these new models would include not only topic areas, but also contrasts between traditional and novel approaches. While the paper addresses some structural models, it also explores integrative approaches such as absorption and separatist models as well as modular frameworks and negotiated programs. This topic is very timely and appropriate given the current crisis facing computing education today.},

  abstract={This article proposes to examine the rise of intensive digitization and technification processes in daily life and the concomitant loss of former historically dominant premachine modes of existence and communication. We shed fresh light on the subject by conducting a historico-philosophical analysis of the evolution of the concept of the machine. The relation between technology and society is investigated in depth through the prism of culture in the latter and the concept of the machine in the former. The evolution of the technosphere is viewed as a series of mutations in the ontological structure of the machine, moving from the equipmental mode of the mechanical tool and ending up with the intelligent machine then the rhizomatic mode of machinic production. Our approach is multidisciplinary, drawing from several traditions, including science, sociology, the philosophy of technology, ontology, and history.},

  abstract={This Cloud Computing is the emerging trend in distributed computing that encourages researchers to investigate its pros and cons for executing scientific workflows. Scheduling of applications modeled as workflows and executed in high performance distributed computing environments like cloud is a computationally hard multi-objective optimization problem. However, it presents various challenges that need to be addressed in order to efficiently utilize cloud resources for workflow applications. In this paper, the authors have critically analyzed the workflow scheduling algorithms for its pros and cons and thereby identified the research issues in workflow scheduling algorithms. The theoretical analysis of `Enhanced Max-Min' scheduling algorithm suggests that if the algorithm is applied for workflow execution in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud, a higher efficiency/lower `makespan' can be achieved if the characteristics of resources are considered while scheduling workflow tasks. Hence the authors have also proposed an extension of `Enhanced Max-Min' algorithm for workflow execution that considers characteristics of resources and `makespan' minimization as a scheduling parameter.},

  abstract={We live in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which permeates all aspects of our lives, from spam filtering to image classification on social media. While it is already well-established in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to the IT field, its impact on the design professions remains relatively unexplored. This essay explores the use of neural networks in architecture, which is arguably the first genuinely 21st-century design technique and discusses experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate unexplored futuristic possible noble forms in architecture. In this way this paper also raises the question if machine can generate noble forms through its creative data optimization process. In this process one of the most famous heritages building of Bangladesh 60 dome mosque (Shat Gombuj Moshjid) has been examined to get expected result. Furthermore, this paper discusses how AI can be used as a personalized tool for architects to generate and express design ideas. It evaluates popular datasets for architectural purposes and considers the potential outcomes of experiments. The input of AI in the design process could usher in a new era of architectural design. As data continues to grow, it is shaping our collective future. Therefore, this paper concludes that it is essential to prepare our trained datasets to accept the future which might open up an extraordinary new chapter in the architectural realm.},

  abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has been linked with significant deterioration of neuro-cognitive health. The forced abnormal isolation mandated by the lockdown has been associated with increased internal stressors, leading to early onset of mental health degeneration. The current challenge for the medical practitioners is to identify tools to help slow down such neurocognitive decline. In this project, we develop a model of sentiment manipulation using linguistic cues that can regulate the affective-motivational state of an individual to reduce triggers of neurocognitive degeneration. Based on the model insights, we build a user-friendly, low-cost Web App, customizable in many languages, to identify and score the primary sentiment of any audio or text to help reduce exposure to content that can potentially trigger internal stressors. In a randomized control experiment with 160 subjects, we find that participants in our target group who consumed content with positive or upbeat cues over a period of 60 days were 3.68 times less likely to report loneliness, 2.1 times less likely to report depressive thoughts and emotions and 1.75 times less likely to report forgetfulness than our control group, providing promising evidence of the potential of positive linguistic cues to prevent or slow down neuro-cognitive degeneration.},

The top macro-layer enables human teachers to interactively inject a representation of abstract concepts (e.g., location) into the developmental process. This architecture is applied to a navigation problem, and its superiority over one-layer architecture is confirmed in comparative experiments using simulated Lidar sensor data. The robotic navigation demonstrates its robustness in accomplishing complicated task in clutter outdoor environments.},

  abstract={A command and control system is intended to provide a responsible authority the means to employ his weapons and forces to achieve certain objectives for an assigned mission. The overall organization and even the details of the information system design are intimately interwoven with the mission, the objectives to be achieved in pursuance of the mission, the degree of formalization of the requirements of the objectives, and probably to a large extent the image (or context) the system designers have of the system in its operational environment. In this discussion we have attempted to show that the military doctrine of centralized command and decentralized execution is, to a large extent, becoming more amenable to mechanization, viz., by the notion of the distributed data processor, which is for all practical purposes an interconnected set of computers that can share a common problem load. This kind of system configuration gives an added degree of freedom to the information system design but has not necessarily simplified the problems associated with command and control. It adds to the designer's repertoire another configuration for a system that could be advantageous under certain circumstances. It is also shown that the process of formalization of command and control systems can be literally as important as the resulting product. The necessity to define functions, tasks, objectives, and their interrelationships can disclose potential advantages or hazards in systems that might otherwise remain undetected.},

  abstract={Pet robots, a sub-class of robotic companions, have garnered the interest of the scientific community and the public recently, due to their potential to help humans with everyday activities and enhance the psychological well-being of individuals across various aspects, for example, they can either serve as mere products of entertainment or as an alternative solution to mental healthcare. However, challenges must be solved when developing and crafting a pet robot that can adapt to the mentioned uses. A significant problem is that pet robots must bring their owners the experience that is close to having a real pet, both physically and psychologically. Therefore, there are specific requirements for the robot design and the variety of robot behaviors to make the robot as friendly and interactive as possible. This research aims to develop a versatile companion pet robot suitable for individuals of all ages, featuring a user-friendly design and high-end functionalities. The robot can move around and is equipped with basic functionalities such as voice recognition, emotional expressions, etc. Additionally, the robot integrated an advanced feature of autonomous thought processing, enabling it to generate responses and interact more dynamically and intuitively with its users.},

  year={2016},
  volume={28},
  number={2},
  pages={308-318},
  abstract={The ability to adaptively shift between exploration and exploitation control states is critical for optimizing behavioral performance. Converging evidence from primate electrophysiology and computational neural modeling has suggested that this ability may be mediated by the broad norepinephrine projections emanating from the locus coeruleus (LC) [Aston-Jones, G., & Cohen, J. D. An integrative theory of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine function: Adaptive gain and optimal performance. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 28, 403–450, 2005]. There is also evidence that pupil diameter covaries systematically with LC activity. Although imperfect and indirect, this link makes pupillometry a useful tool for studying the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system in humans and in high-level tasks. Here, we present a novel paradigm that examines how the pupillary response during exploration and exploitation covaries with individual differences in fluid intelligence during analogical reasoning on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices. Pupillometry was used as a noninvasive proxy for LC activity, and concurrent think-aloud verbal protocols were used to identify exploratory and exploitative solution periods. This novel combination of pupillometry and verbal protocols from 40 participants revealed a decrease in pupil diameter during exploitation and an increase during exploration. The temporal dynamics of the pupillary response was characterized by a steep increase during the transition to exploratory periods, sustained dilation for many seconds afterward, and followed by gradual return to baseline. Moreover, the individual differences in the relative magnitude of pupillary dilation accounted for 16% of the variance in Advanced Progressive Matrices scores. Assuming that pupil diameter is a valid index of LC activity, these results establish promising preliminary connections between the literature on locus coeruleus norepinephrine-mediated cognitive control and the literature on analogical reasoning and fluid intelligence.},

  abstract={The purpose of this ‘Innovative Practice’ article is to propose a multidisciplinary project spanning discrete mathematics, computer programming and electronics through the study of Kaprekar's routine. The theoretical component consists of teaching the concepts of arithmetic in different bases and cycle searches in groups of finite cardinality. Students will then realise this algorithm computationally, learning notions of iterative and modular programming. Finally they will implement it with combinatorial and sequential digital electronics with circuit simulation software. Kaprekar's routine is as follows: choose a number, then form the two numbers from the rearrangement of the digits in descending and ascending order and take their difference. Repeat this procedure with the result of the subtraction until you recover a previous number, and hence the process is a repeating cycle, or the result settles on a constant called the Kaprekar constant. The result of the routine depends on both the base and the number of digits. For example, in base ten, an initial choice of any 4 digit number will always result in the constant 6174 whereas a 5 digit number will result in a cycle of 3 or 4 numbers. This simple routine can be studied from multiple approaches, giving rise to a rich multidisciplinary student experience. From the mathematical approach, we can easily find these constants in base 10 on the internet, but less so in base n. We present the demonstration for 3-digit numbers in base 10. Using a computer programming approach, we have developed a Python script to find these constants and cycles in bases 2 to 10. We describe the algorithms of 11 functions contained in this script as a possible teaching template. Taking a digital electronics approach, we developed several circuits and sub-circuits using the open-source software package Logisim. We also present the automated creation of circuits from truth tables using Karnaugh tables. In addition, this project naturally contains measures against student plagiarism. The Kaprekar constants or cycles depend on the bases used, and hence the same project can be assigned to several groups of students who cannot copy from one another. In short, the algorithm for finding Kaprekar's constants and cycles is very simple, yet the mathematical demonstrations, computer programming implementation and digital electronics simulation are far less trivial. But in the end, this project would produce a prototype that even primary school children can use in a little game!},

  abstract={Motivated learning is a new machine learning approach that extends reinforcement learning idea to dynamically changing, and highly structured environments. In this approach a machine is capable of defining its own objectives and learns to satisfy them though an internal reward system. The machine is forced to explore the environment in response to externally applied negative (pain) signals that it must minimize. In doing so, it discovers relationships between objects observed through its sensory inputs and actions it performs on the observed objects. Observed concepts are not predefined but are emerging as a result of successful operations. For the optimum development of concepts and related skills, the machine operates in the protective environment that gradually increases its complexity. Simulation illustrates the advantage of this gradual increase in environment complexity for machine development. Comparison to reinforcement learning indicates weakness of the later method in learning proper behavior, even in such protective environments with gradually increasing complexity. The method shows how mental development stimulates learning of new concepts and at the same time benefits from this learning. Thus the method addresses a well know problem of merging connectionist (bottom-up) and symbolic (top down) approaches for intelligent autonomous machine operation in developmental robotics.},

  title={Exploring Incremental Classifiers For Predicting Student Performance Across Semesters},

  abstract={Accurately predicting student performance in advance has become crucial in educational systems to ensure timely interventions and enhance academic support. This research investigates the application of incremental learning algorithms to predict student grades across multiple semesters for a course. The traditional classifiers may not suit the student’s academic prediction since the data is being added frequently, so there is a necessity of using classifiers that support the incremental data. Various incremental classifier categories, such as Naive Bayes, linear models, tree-based models, ensemble methods, and neighbor-based models, were used to assess their efficacy in real-time student data. Student performance data for four semesters are used to study the dynamic learning process of the classifier. Each semester’s data is trained and updated with the previous semester’s model. This allows each model to adapt when new data is introduced every semester. The study will examine how well these incremental models perform on incremental data by tracking performance measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and training time for each semester. The findings will highlight the suitable incremental classifier to predict the student’s grade over various periods and will provide key insights for educators.},
