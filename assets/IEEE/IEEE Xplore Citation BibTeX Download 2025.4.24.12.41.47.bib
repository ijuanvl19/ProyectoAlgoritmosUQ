  abstract={Our objective is language-based search of large-scale image and video datasets. For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and reranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art. We also extend our method to the video domain, improving the state of the art on the VATEX dataset.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={329-338},
  abstract={Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible changes to input pixels that can change the prediction of deep learning models. Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.},

  title={Thinking Inside the Box: A Tutorial on Grey-Box Bayesian Optimization}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the objective function is a black box. However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these “grey-box” BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called “white-box” first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.},

  title={Thinking Like a Developer? Comparing the Attention of Humans with Neural Models of Code}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={867-879},
  abstract={Neural models of code are successfully tackling various prediction tasks, complementing and sometimes even outperforming traditional program analyses. While most work focuses on end-to-end evaluations of such models, it often remains unclear what the models actually learn, and to what extent their reasoning about code matches that of skilled humans. A poor understanding of the model reasoning risks deploying models that are right for the wrong reason, and taking decisions based on spurious correlations in the training dataset. This paper investigates to what extent the attention weights of effective neural models match the reasoning of skilled humans. To this end, we present a methodology for recording human attention and use it to gather 1,508 human attention maps from 91 participants, which is the largest such dataset we are aware of. Computing human-model correlations shows that the copy attention of neural models often matches the way humans reason about code (Spearman rank coefficients of 0.49 and 0.47), which gives an empirical justification for the intuition behind copy attention. In contrast, the regular attention of models is mostly uncorrelated with human attention. We find that models and humans sometimes focus on different kinds of tokens, e.g., strings are important to humans but mostly ignored by models. The results also show that human-model agreement positively correlates with accurate predictions by a model, which calls for neural models that even more closely mimic human reasoning. Beyond the insights from our study, we envision the release of our dataset of human attention maps to help understand future neural models of code and to foster work on human-inspired models.},

  volume={},

  pages={21781-21790},
  abstract={We present a comprehensive study on a new task named image color aesthetics assessment (ICAA), which aims to assess color aesthetics based on human perception. ICAA is important for various applications such as imaging measurement and image analysis. However, due to the highly diverse aesthetic preferences and numerous color combinations, ICAA presents more challenges than conventional image quality assessment tasks. To advance ICAA research, 1) we propose a baseline model called the Delegate Transformer, which not only deploys deformable transformers to adaptively allocate interest points, but also learns human color space segmentation behavior by the dedicated module. 2) We elaborately build a color-oriented dataset, ICAA17K, containing 17K images, covering 30 popular color combinations, 80 devices and 50 scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 1,500 people. Moreover, we develop a large-scale benchmark of 15 methods, the most comprehensive one thus far based on two datasets, SPAQ and ICAA17K. Our work, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but more importantly offers the community a roadmap to explore solutions for ICAA. Code and dataset are available in here.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={797-816},
  abstract={Proof-of-Learning (PoL) proposes that a model owner logs training checkpoints to establish a proof of having expended the computation necessary for training. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing—computing a proof for a stolen model—is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has invalidated this observation.In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of PoL—meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof. On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to open problems in learning theory. We conclude that one cannot develop a provably robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization in deep learning.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},

  pages={232-238},
  abstract={Cyber security experts in the U.S. and around the globe assess potential threats to their organizations by evaluating potential attackers' skills, knowledge, resources, access to the target organization and motivation to offend (i.e. SKRAM). Unfortunately, this model fails to incorporate insights regarding online offenders' traits and the conditions surrounding the development of online criminal event. Drawing on contemporary criminological models, we present a theoretical rationale for revising the SKRAM model. The revised model suggests that in addition to the classical SKRAM components, both individual attributes and certain offline and online circumstances fuel cyber attackers' motivation to offend, and increase the probability that a cyber-attack will be launched against an organization. Consistent with our proposed model, and its potential in predicting the occurrence of different types of cyber-dependent crimes against organizations, we propose that Information Technology professionals' efforts to facilitate safe computing environments should design new approaches for collecting indicators regarding attackers' potential threat, and predicting the occurrence and timing of cyber-dependent crimes.},

  abstract={A systematic and consistent framework for software modeling is introduced, being the core of a Software-Intensive-Systems-Engineering (SWISE) academic course, which has been taught by the author in over 50 classes over 12 years. The approach is based upon a general perception and definition of a “system” which can be applied to any level of system decomposition, throughout subsystems, components, units etc. Five principle levels-of-interest are introduced and appropriate UML models are suggested at each level, preserving model consistency within and between levels. Each modeled entity along the process possesses a functional, a structural and a behavioral model. The use of models is demonstrated not only at the analysis and design stages of development but also at the integration and testing stages. The entire agenda of the SWISE course is presented, detailing the instructional tools and case-studies used during the course.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={This paper revisits replication coupled with checkpointing for fail-stop errors. Replication enables the application to survive many fail-stop errors, thereby allowing for longer checkpointing periods. Previously published works use replication with the no-restart strategy, which works as follows: (i) compute the application Mean Time To Interruption (MTTI) $M$ as a function of the number of processor pairs and the individual processor Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); (ii) use checkpointing period $T_{MTTI}^{\text{no}}=\sqrt{2MC}$ a la Young/Daly, where $C$ is the checkpoint duration; and (iii) never restart failed processors until the application crashes. We introduce the restart strategy where failed processors are restarted after each checkpoint. We compute the optimal checkpointing period $T_{opt}^{\text{rs}}$ for this strategy, which is much larger than $T_{MTTI}^{\text{no}}$, thereby decreasing I/O pressure. We show through simulations that using $T_{opt}^{\text{rs}}$ and the restart strategy, instead of $T_{M T T I}^{\text{no}}$ and the usual no-restart strategy, significantly decreases the overhead induced by replication.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks using for real-world classification task require high reliability and robustness. However, the Softmax output by the last layer of network is often over-confident. We propose a novel confidence estimation method by considering model quality for deep classification models. Two metrics, MQ-Repres and MQ-Discri are developed accordingly to evaluate the model quality, and also provide a new confidence estimation called MQ-Conf for online inference. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by the $3D$ semantic segmentation tasks using three different deep networks. Through confusion analysis and feature visualization we show the rationality and reliability of the model quality quantification method.11This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U22A2061 and High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University.},

  abstract={Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.},

The paper is an abridged version of a full report on the event. The paper highlights the high status accorded to empirical evidence (generated, in particular by randomized controlled trials), and suggests that a more balanced view of evidence, as being composed of empiricist, rationalist, and historicist material, is of value. Modeling and simulation constitute sources of rationalist evidence. Tensions between different types of evidence are identified, and the tension between statistics and stories as evidential forms is explored. The paper concludes on an optimistic note: there are clear signs that within the UK National Health Service, modeling and simulation are being taken more seriously as sources of evidence.},

This descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.},

  abstract={Full paper, Research-to-Practice. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics.},

Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students.},

  abstract={While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.},

Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning "Scratch." This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need.

This paper addresses the need to create tools that effectively support the learning of programming and the development of computational thinking, highlighting why video games can be an effective educational tool for it and also attract new students to STEM. The Game4Coding Erasmus+ project proposes the design of a video game called CodeQuest, using a game genre that has not been frequently used before to address the teaching of programming, the monster tamer genre. We consider that video games have a number of benefits such as that stimulate active learning, are engaging for a wide range of students, and present information in a way that is attractive to learners. We want to explore this kind of game's effectiveness as a learning tool as well as its effect on the perception of STEM disciplines and programming to attract new public to coding (especially girls).},

  abstract={Teaching autonomous and intelligent transportation systems in higher education has traditionally focused on theory, often lacking comprehensive coverage of the practical techniques required for real-world applications. To overcome this, we developed a new university course centered around hands-on learning with a modular autonomous small-scale vehicle platform called F1TENTH. This paper presents a detailed overview of the new course design, its underlying philosophy, the individual teaching modules, and the modular hardware/software of the F1TENTH platform. This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses. The results show that approximately 80% of all involved students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules significantly increased their motivation to learn. More than 70% of the students agreed that the hardware enhanced their understanding of the material The findings demonstrate that our course setup and the F1TENTH hardware effectively combine theoretical knowledge with practical application, greatly enhancing the educational outcomes and the students' computational thinking skills. Future research is needed to explore the long-term impact of hands-on learning on students' career development in intelligent autonomous systems.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been widely integrated into K-12 classrooms through programming education. Numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. Blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for K-12 programming courses. With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. Suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices.},

  abstract={We describe trial applications of fuzzy sets to data retrieval. The objectives are to test their ability to achieve conceptual matching between retrieved objects and the user's intention and to connect real data with symbolic notations. The algorithm proposed retrieves data that conceptually fit the meanings of the entered keyword. An algorithm is described that uses fuzzy sets to handle word ambiguity (the main cause of vagueness in the meaning of a word). It is based on conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs), which represent the meaning of words by chaining other related words. Two trial applications of this algorithm to data retrieval are described. First, an application to image retrieval shows variation of data retrieval with conceptual matching and transformation of numeric values into symbols. Next, an application to the agent recommending a TV program shows the method that lets CFSs fit to the sense of a user by Hebbian learning.},

  abstract={Physical space appeared with the birth of the earth. With the emergence of social space, thinking space, and cyberspace (STCs), things in physical space are continuously enriched. Consequently, the PhiNet, an abstracted network concept such as relationships between things, is becoming more complex. Physical space plays a fundamental role in promoting the connection and development with the other three spaces. We think that PhiNet of Things (PoT) is a unified description of pure physical space and the evolving physical space affected by STCs. While the Internet of Things (IoT) is described from a cyber view, in this article, the definition of PoT is put forward from a natural view. Besides, the evolution of PoT is identified by the time sequence in which the four spaces appeared. At each stage, research is carried out from two perspectives of things and PhiNet, and two specific examples are presented to illustrate the change process of things and the related PhiNet. In addition, two applications are listed to explain the usability of PoT in the current development stage. Finally, the article gives the possible future development direction of PoT. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the fundamental role of physical space in the continuous development through time sequence.},
