  abstract={Crowd RE is an emerging avenue for engaging the general public or the so called crowd in variety of requirements engineering tasks. Crowd RE scales RE by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd RE, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd RE process, itself, by facilitating novel workflows combining crowd and machine intelligence.To facilitate automated techniques for Crowd RE, first, we showcase a crowd-acquired dataset, consisting of requirements and their ratings on multiple dimensions for the smart homes application domain. Our dataset is unique in that it contains not only requirements, but also the characteristics of the crowd workers who produced those requirements including their demographics, personality traits, and creative potential. Understanding the crowd characteristics is essential to developing effective Crowd RE processes. Second, we outline key challenges involved in automating Crowd RE and describe, how our dataset can serve as a foundation for developing such automated techniques.},

  abstract={There are various bio inspired and evolutionary approaches including genetic programming (GP), Neural Network, Evolutionary programming (EP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) used for the routing protocols in ad hoc and sensor wireless networks. There are constraints involved in these protocols due to the mobility and non infrastructure nature of an ad hoc and sensor networks. We study in this research work a probabilistic performance evaluation frameworks and Swarm Intelligence approaches (PSO, ACO) for routing protocols. The performance evaluation metrics employed for wireless and ad hoc routing algorithms is, (a) routing overhead, (b) route optimality, and (c) energy consumption. This survey gives critical analysis of PSO and ACO based algorithms with other approaches applied for the optimization of an ad hoc and wireless sensor network routing protocols.},

  abstract={Mind evolutionary computation (MEC) is a new approach of evolutionary computation (EC) proposed by Chengyi Sun in 1998. It has excellent performances on various aspects. Operations of similartaxis and dissimilation are employed in MEC rather than crossover and mutation operators in GAs, so the performance have improved a lot. The excellent performances are accomplished also due to three mechanisms of MEC, which are evolutionary directionality mechanism, memory mechanism and harmony mechanism between exploitation and exploration. This paper surveys the study and the main results during 1998-2001. The results demonstrate that a preliminary system has already been established for MEC. A detailed and complete description of MEC by pseudo codes is given first time. A modified result on convergence velocity of similartaxis process and some changes of glossaries are also given in the paper.},

  abstract={For enhanced education at the level of University courses such as those in biology or biotechnology, one of the key elements is the need of time and expertise to allow the student to familiarize laboratory techniques in par with regular theory. The Sakshat Amrita virtual biotechnology lab project focusing on virtualizing wet-lab techniques and integrating the learning experience has added a new dimension to the regular teaching courses at the University. Establishing virtual labs requires both domain knowledge and virtualizing skills via programming, animation and device-based feedback. Challenges in the biotechnology sector in setting up a laboratory that integrates both the feel and phenomenon includes the medley of multiple techniques. This paper reports one such cost-effective process used in virtualizing a real biotechnology lab at the University-level. The major challenge in setting up an effective knowledge dissemination for laboratory courses was not only the scientific approach of biotechnology, but included the virtualization aspects such as usage/design scalability, deliverability efficiency, network connectivity issues, security and speed of adaptability to incorporate and update changes into existing experiments. This paper also discusses an issue-specific case-study of a functional virtual lab in biotechnology and its many issues and challenges.},

  abstract={Computers have transformed work and play, transportation and medicine, entertainment and sports. Yet for all their power, these machines still cannot perform simple tasks that a child can do, such as navigating an unknown room or using a pencil. The solution is finally coming within reach. It will emerge from the intersection of two major pursuits: the reverse engineering of the brain and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Over the next 20 years, these two pursuits will combine to usher in a new epoch of intelligent machines. Why do we need to know how the brain works to build intelligent machines? Although machine-learning techniques such as deep neural networks have recently made impressive gains, they are still a world away from being intelligent, from being able to understand and act in the world the way that we do. The only example of intelligence, of the ability to learn from the world, to plan and to execute, is the brain. Therefore, we must understand the principles underlying human intelligence and use them to guide us in the development of truly intelligent machines.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={7713-7717},
  abstract={Despite the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, large pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the decision-making process of it in ELBERT. Our code is publicly available online.1},

  abstract={Reconfigurable manufacturing systems have the ability to evolve in response to a change in their environment or a modification of their composition (after a failure of one of its components for instance). This paper propose to use the concept of architecture and configuration to describe both the invariant part of the system as well as the changeable one. The criticality analysis is computed on a configuration. Results can then be used to choose between configurations, enhance one or analyze reconfiguration capability of the configuration. Tools for applying this metric on the model are presented. Results are given for a sample RMS configuration},

  abstract={Students experience constant problems in their introductory programming courses. Along with difficulties to cope with abstract programming concepts students tend to experience fear and lack of motivation to learn programming. In order to make programming more interesting and to make programming concepts easier to comprehend an intelligent assistant which enables students to ask question about their programming lessons in a simple and familiar way just as they would ask the lecturer is proposed. In this way the process of getting the right information and answer gets faster and also more interesting and engaging compared to classic approach. Along with getting the desired answer faster this kind of approach increases motivation of students to spend more time in learning programming because of interesting new technology that is used as an aiding tool in their programming education. The results about students' attitude towards such approach and its effect on students' motivation and amount of time spent in learning are presented and discussed.},

This idea is considered in the context of a revolutionary approach to achieving practical thousandfold parallelism by the year 2000 that calls for immediately building machines with thousands of processors, using whatever architectural ideas are currently deemed feasible from the system packaging viewpoint. This is contrasted with evolutionary approach, which is to methodically double the number of processors each year, while nurturing and enlarging the software base correspondingly.<>},

  pages={369-373},
  abstract={The purpose of this study is to apply the Simplified Pivot Pairwise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA-S) weighting model with ranking criteria or priorities in determining Employee Performance Evaluation. The method used for the assessment of employee performance evaluation is the center of ranking and ranking order using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), so as to produce rankings that can be compared with the best alternative results with weighted values generated by each method. To apply the MAUT approach in decision support systems, the determination of employee performance evaluation assessment has the criteria of initiative, team working ability, communication skills, discipline, responsibility, creativity and innovation, customer service, and commitment to company values. This research aims at evaluating employee performance using MAUT and PIPRECIA-S in order to weight the criteria based on the assessment of decision makers more objectively. Based on the process of completing the application of the MAUT method using PIPRECIA-S weighting in the assessment of employee performance evaluation, among the 6 employees as the subjects of the research, the best performance was obtained by employee 4 with a final score of 0.435 as rank 1, and rank 2 was obtained by Employee 1 with a final score of 0.328, while rank 3 was obtained by Employee 3 with a final score of 0.251.},

  abstract={Rather than acting as a review or analysis of the field, this essay focuses squarely on the motivations for investigating open-endedness and the opportunities it opens up. It begins by contemplating the awesome accomplishments of evolution in nature and the profound implications if such a process could be ignited on a computer. Some of the milestones in our understanding so far are then discussed, finally closing by highlighting the grand challenge of formalizing open-endedness as a computational process that can be encoded as an algorithm. The main contribution is to articulate why open-endedness deserves a place alongside artificial intelligence as one of the great computational challenges, and opportunities, of our time.},

  abstract={We developed three home-made modeling programs to design thermally assisted magnetic recording heads: optical beam propagation method for waveguides, optical finite difference time domain method for plasmon generators, and thermal/micromagnetic finite difference method for the recording media. These models lead to the following results. To get higher throughput efficiency of the waveguide, the periodic wavy thickness of the inlet can provide better inlet coupling with laser diode light, and the wavy taper shape can improve the propagation efficiency. As for plasmon generators, the model requires waveguide, recording media and main-pole to estimate the correct performance, because the optimized design depends on all of these parts. Our proposed sharp pointed plasmon generator can provide tiny near field spot, and it must have good scalability for narrow track recording. In addition to these optics models, we performed recording process simulation. As a result, depending on the condition of the thermal spot and head field alignment, either thermal or magnetic field can be dominant in creating the final magnetic transition in the media. The signal to noise ratio and the transition curvature are greatly affected by the recording process.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={In the music industry, researchers have been developing an approach to music as an informational phenomenon for decades. Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.},

Current research on risk assessment focuses on the calculation methods and assessment models of the risk value. Also, lots of automatic assessment tools have been applied to risk assessment. However, these methods didn't take human errors in risk assessment work into consideration, thus couldn't solve the problem brought by the influence of human errors on final assessment results. As a result, this paper introduces the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) which is a mature technique in human reliability analysis into the process of information security risk assessment. Combined with current analysis techniques of human errors in computer science and aiming at the calculation process of the risk value of important assets in information security risk assessment, research on the calculation method of risk value considering human reliability is carried out in this paper. The calculation method of human error rates in the entire process of risk value calculation is proposed. An example is provided to verify the method proposed in this paper.},

Social media is gradually more popular and people use them for sharing their sentiments and harmful emotions related to suicidal thoughts. An effective approach is required to investigate for identifying risk factors associated with suicide on social media. The objective is to propose some learning models to evaluate social media data to identify persons having suicidal tendencies. A large data consisting of 8452 tweets are collected from Twitter, pre-processed and bags of words were applied. Different machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Recurrent Neural Network, Artificial Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory were applied for classifying the tweets in two sets: suicidal and non-suicidal. The performance of these learning models is further evaluated on three parameters: accuracy, precision and recall. These models have shown significant results on the parameters.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the question: “Can Information and Communications Technology (ICT) helps to improve primary school students' geometry achievements for rectangles?” The applied educational software consisted of a story and several activities with and without the use of computers which were designed following the background of Realistic Mathematics Education for geometry concepts; referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Model’ (PSM). In addition, we use a mathematical test referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Test’ (PST) to explore the use of ICT in the primary classroom for teaching basic geometrical concepts. It is a task orientated test which attends to measure the level of geometry competence developed for students of the first grade. The study dealt with students in the first grade of primary school of Athens and Crete, who were divided into two teams (experimental and control). The experimental group consisted of 113 students, who were taught of rectangles by the support of computers. There were 121 students in the control group, which received only the traditional science instruction for rectangles. Students in both groups were pre-tested and post-tested for their geometry performance for rectangles. The results of the study indicated that teaching and learning through ICT is an interactive process for children at primary school level and has a positive effect for geometry education of rectangles.},

  abstract={User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design have a very important role in the development of digital products and services. UX quality is determined by the extent to which the UI developed can meet the needs of users. There are several factors that influence the quality of UX, one of which is its usability. Usability is one of the important concepts in UI/UX design, which aims to create products that are easy to use, effective, and satisfying for users. Lova.ID, a company that sells women's fashion, requires an E-Commerce website system to increase marketing and sales. To find out whether the UI/UX prototype can be used according to user needs, it is necessary to carry out a usability testing and analysis. This study aims to test the UI/UX prototype that has been made. Tests based on effectiveness, efficiency, and user usability use the time based efficiency method and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results of this study note that users can complete all tasks properly to determine the effectiveness of the prototype with a percentage of 100%. In addition, the average time needed to do all tasks is included in the fast classification. And, the usability of the prototype is at level B, which means it is well accepted by users.},

That is, even if an MLP can provide correct answers, we cannot understand the reasons why it makes these decisions. In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.},

  abstract={With the continuous implementation of application services in the field of artificial intelligence in the industry, the academic research on Al branch science is becoming more and more in-depth. NLP, that is, natural language processing, plays an extremely important role in the transition from the in-formation age to the intelligent age. Computer linguistics, a highly interdisciplinary emerging discipline derived from it, is also developing by leaps and bounds. Chinese natural language processing takes the conversion of natural language as the basic principle, follows the research ideas based on rules and statistics, and appropriately adds some reliable examples to complete the translation process. This paper discusses the key problems of computer linguistics based on Chinese NLP, understands the basic concepts of Chinese natural language processing through detailed analysis, and then studies the key problems and steps of Chinese natural language processing.},

  abstract={How to use various kinds of intelligent technology to find an optimal product design scheme is very important in today's highly competitive marketplace. Based on the analyzing and summarizing of current intelligent design methods, an optimization design system with hybrid intelligence, which integrates human intelligence with machine intelligence was explored. Intelligent tools such as genetic algorithm (GA) and case-based reasoning (CBR), were used to find a feasible and optimal solution quickly in a large design space. The way to combine the designer's intelligence during the whole automatic optimization searching process was described. The optimization design system not only integrates the intelligence of design examples, experts, designers and computer, but also supports the designers to utilize all the knowledge resources to design. Finally, a case study is used to specify the implementation procedure of this method.},
