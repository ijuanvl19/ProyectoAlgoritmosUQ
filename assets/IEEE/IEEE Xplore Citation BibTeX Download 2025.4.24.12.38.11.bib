  abstract={While block-based programming has successfully eliminated critical syntactic barriers to programming, it remains unclear how effectively it aids in overcoming semantic, logical, and pragmatic programming challenges that hinder computational thinking. These challenges are likely to far outweigh the syntactic ones. With the goal of creating a highly accessible programming tool for young students using mobile devices, we explored the concept of pragmatic prebugging to begin addressing these challenges. By pragmatic prebugging, we refer to proactive debugging tools designed to prevent logical errors. This article introduces RULER.game as a Computational Thinking Tool with built-in pragmatic prebugging, enabling novice programmers to create games through a paradigm we call proxy-based programming. A small study exploring error rates found statistically significant performance improvements of proxy-based programming compared to block-based programming.},

  abstract={Cognitive psychology investigates perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. Kahneman’s dual-system theory elucidates the human decision-making process, distinguishing between the rapid, intuitive System 1 and the deliberative, rational System 2. Recent advancements have positioned large language Models (LLMs) as formidable tools nearing human-level proficiency in various cognitive tasks. Nonetheless, the presence of a dual-system framework analogous to human cognition in LLMs remains unexplored. This study introduces the CogniDual Framework for LLMs (CFLLMs), designed to assess whether LLMs can, through self-training, evolve from deliberate deduction to intuitive responses, thereby emulating the human process of acquiring and mastering new information. Our findings reveal the cognitive mechanisms behind LLMs’ response generation, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities in cognitive psychology. Practically, self-trained models can provide faster responses to certain queries, reducing computational demands during inference.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to look at Cloud Computing Security. The term “cloud computing” refers to a way of delivering services over the internet. As a network service, computing resources are made available. These services are cost-effective, scalable, and self-contained. Cloud computing is responsible for the IT industry's rapid growth. Despite its many benefits, it has a number of security concerns that must be addressed. In order to make Cloud Computing even more secure and trustworthy, some efforts must be made against the model's hazards. All of the risks linked with Cloud Computing, as well as potential cures, are evaluated in this paper. Various resources like as memory, software, CPU, and network services are offered on-demand via the internet in cloud computing. Because all resources such as hardware, software, and network are used without physically purchasing them, the company's primary investment in the cloud is retained. Many advances are being implemented in the cloud platform to deliver a better experience for cloud users.},

  abstract={Many works have been done in an effort to create systems for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes. Although most of them are related to the recipe ingredient lists, few works have been done to evaluate and generate the preparation steps of culinary recipes. This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.},

  abstract={Computational chains which 'remember' that a computation has already been performed and its results are available for further use have been implemented using special classes of Matlab containers. A simple version management mechanism keeps track of any changes made to containers in the chain, and supports storage and retrieval of design data. Computational chains can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated version of management mechanism for maintaining a complete design-history database. Advantages of the computational chains become more apparent as the complexity of the work undertaken with them increases, so in this paper we describe quite a complex 'case study', which we think is a fairly typical of part of an industrial control system analysis. It is based on the use of a multivariable Smith predictor for a multivariable plant which contains time delays.},

  abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) have become so popular that it has changed the Internet to a more collaborative environment. Now, a third of the world's population participates in OSNs, forming communities, and producing and consuming media in different ways. The recent boom of artificial intelligence technologies provides new opportunities to help improve the processing and mining of social data. In this article, an algorithm that can detect communities in the OSNs using the concepts of granular computing in rough sets is proposed. In this information model, a social network as a rough set granular social network (RGSN) is modeled. A new community detection algorithm named granular-based community detection (GBCD) is implemented. This article also defines and uses two measures, namely, a granular community factor and an object community factor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four real-world data sets as well as computer-generated data sets. The model is compared with other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for the values of modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Omega index, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-measure. The cumulative performance of the GBCD algorithm is found to be 3.99, which outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},

  abstract={The objective of present research is comprehensive study related to 5G technology of mobile communication for year 2020 in Indian prospective. The European and American forums started thinking seriously about the next generation of wireless and mobile communication for 2020. A European forum named METIS, Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty (2020). Information Society started working on funded project to identify the 5G future scenarios especially in European environment. METIS funded project also involves many leading technology companies. The guidelines decided by these projects will become basis of shape of fifth generation of wireless technologies. The 4G concept shave already moved to standardization phase, we must begin to work on the building blocks of the 5G networks.5G technology will provide low battery consumption, more secure features and 4A's paradigm ie any rate, anytime, anywhere and affordable. There is a need to study local scenarios and information technology related local demand to give a direction to 5G technology development. The future technology is required to be indigenous, capable to handle local social and economic issues so that use of Information technology may be able to address our issues more effectively. Presently, most of the Europe and USA may not be compared with India, China and third world. Better infrastructure, better economy and less population are some features of Europe and USA. There challenges are different and they develop technology for their growth. In most of the cases we adopt it large cost. Applying technologies in core and routed social aspect is big challenge for nation like India. As our technology and our needs and wants are different from front runners, we need to design the technology more judiciously and economically. We need a technology which enables poor person percentage to grow fast. In this view, we have indentified our own scenario and technological requirement to implement 5th generation of mobile and wireless technologies.},

  abstract={The design of communication architecture over a sea environment is challenging since it requires careful analysis of different factors such as multipath propagation, antenna characteristics and mobility that affect a signal. Although existing work has addressed a few factors, there is no work which provides a complete analysis of path loss incorporating such factors and how they affect on Received Signal Level. To get a clear picture of what work has been proposed in the literature, we present a survey article that gathers information about various propagation models used and proposed for maritime environment. We analyze each work based on the simulation set up, number of factors considered, error differences between simulated and experimental data and so on. We believe this article will help to identify the current state in simulation and analysis of communication links over the sea environment.},

  abstract={The main objective of this paper is to present a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculation approach, based on physical based simulation models, for the predictive maintenance of a production plant using Prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques. The resources of the production plant are modelled in order to enable the simulation of their functionalities. A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities. Efficient algorithms and technologies for data analysis and prediction are utilized. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be predicted as a result from the simulation of physically-based models, without the machines' operation being stopped, as it happens in the common predictive maintenance solutions.},

  abstract={AI systems have seen significant adoption in various domains. At the same time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by the inability to fully trust an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides, fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability are vital to developing trust in AI systems. As stated in Describing Trustworthy AI,aa.https://www.ibm.com/watson/trustworthy-ai. “Trust comes through understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were included are crucial to understand.” The subarea of explaining AI systems has come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on “domain knowledge,” including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use. Contemporary XAI methods are yet addressed explanations that enable decision-making similar to an expert. Figure 1 shows the stages of adoption of an AI system into the real world.},

  abstract={Plagiarism is known as illegal use of others' part of work or whole work as one's own in any field such as art, poetry, literature, cinema, research and other creative forms of study. Plagiarism is one of the important issues in academic and research fields and giving more concern in academic systems. The situation is even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and minimize the plagiarism among students.},

The first of these models, the computation independent model (CIM), is used to define the business system, and it is usually represented with UML models. Natural language is widely used in requirements engineering as it is generally understandable by stakeholders encouraging their participation. Therefore, in order to enhance the first stages of MDA software development, we propose to define natural language oriented requirements models and derive from them a CIM. To achieve this integration we describe in this paper an automatic process to derive a business class diagram representing the structural aspects of a CIM starting from natural language oriented models.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of internet access has given rise to a digital era. The availability of internet access has pushed almost 70% of the population to switch to internet for their daily needs and accessories. Mainly, E-commerce platforms are being used at a much higher rate than ever before. People who buy from these e-commerce platforms make decisions on whether to buy a product or not solely based on the ratings and reviews of a product that are provided by these platforms. Due to the simple nature of this review system, sellers and even individuals tend to exploit it by writing dishonest reviews with an intention of either boosting its ratings or simply to sabotage it. These fake reviews are aimed at deceiving customers and convince them to buy/deter a certain product. Due to the lack of a robust system to identify real and fake reviews, these spams manage to show up on top. To avoid this problem and provide a more efficient way to filter and provide a more efficient way to reviews.

  abstract={A novel modeling method is presented for knowledge intensive representation of engineering objects in product model in order to establish product-wide coordinated decision making during lifecycle of product. The currently prevailing product model space is extended by entities representing human affect driven change attempt, product behavior, change affect zone, and contextual change chain. The purpose of this modeling is utilization of possibilities offered by integrated application of sophisticated product modeling and intelligent engineering in order to establish a contribution to find solution for an actual product model related problem in communication between engineers. This problem has been emerged by the new style of engineering where cooperating humans use product model as a medium. The extended model is called as virtual engineering space. Term engineering space refers to the emphasis on serving engineering processes in virtual space. In this paper, definition of key concepts and placing the research in related works are followed by characterization of current virtual product spaces and the related engineering methods. Main contribution of the paper explains a three sectored multilevel model of product and application of this concept at definition of virtual engineering space. Finally, a human intent based process for decision making on product object parameters is explained as an example for application of the proposed virtual engineering space.},

  abstract={Joint behaviors widely existing in intelligent systems are important to investigate the cooperation among intelligent agents. In this paper, we put forward a comprehensive and novel model of joint behaviors in support of analysis and design of intelligent systems. The model includes two kinds of joint behaviors, their formal semantics are defined, and important properties are discussed, specified and proved.},

  abstract={We present a simple analysis showing that channel normalization techniques are less effective when applied to spectral energies obtained by (weighted) summation of components of the short-time Fourier power spectrum of speech. We show that applying channel normalization processing prior to critical band integration or linear predictive all-pole modeling improves the effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract={Different people may have a different learning styles and it is important to provide the most suitable content and course materials for learning. However, determining the learning style may be difficult due to limited information about the learner and lack of a learner profile. The learner has to complete a questionnaire form based on educational theory in order to determine the learning style. Moreover, it is necessary to know the learner's study record related to other factors such as demographic factors. Therefore, an enhanced model to identify learning style is needed. This research aims to address the problem of identifying the learning style for a new student. A learning style classification model was proposed and ensemble classification techniques were implemented. The results showed that the proposed ensemble classification techniques performed better compared to other classification techniques used in the experiment.},

  abstract={Model Driven Engineering proposes the use of models as the main development artifacts. This methodology involves generating code from models and then perhaps adding some details to the generated code. Frequently, it is required to also reverse-engineer code to generate models. Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented programming platform. A functional layer of an airline reservation system is presented as a case study.},
