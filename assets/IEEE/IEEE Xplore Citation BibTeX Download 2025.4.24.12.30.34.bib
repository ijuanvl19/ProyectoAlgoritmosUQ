  abstract={Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.},

  abstract={Understanding computing concepts is one of the foundational elements of computational thinking, which helps students formulate logic and algorithms for effectively developing and designing codes. However, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. This is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. Moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). To tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (NMs) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. In addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (ALIs) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. NM approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while ALIs tend to focus on learner support in activities. Both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. However, little consideration has been given to how NM and ALI approaches could be effectively combined. This research investigates how NM and ALI can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (NMIL). In this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of NMIL, grounded in previous NM and ALI research. We also propose a structured method for creating NMIL. Finally, we also develop a physical NMIL model, based on the structured NMIL creation method, to teach lists in Python, as part of an introductory computer science course.},

  pages={552-567},
  abstract={In this research, we report the empirical findings of a vignette study designed to examine how volitional computer users cope with information technology (IT) threats based on the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT). We incorporate the construct of wishful thinking, an important form of emotion-focused coping behavior that is rarely studied, along with problem-focused coping into a research model to examine the interaction between the two coping approaches. The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users' security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science are used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations of corresponding activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational science and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vigor and empirical approach without the support of a formal model and a rigorous means. In order to formally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of the brain are sought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of the natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of the cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as , inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.},

  abstract={The use of computer programming in K-12 spread into schools worldwide in the 70s and 80s of the last century, but it disappeared from the educational landscape in the early 90s. With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.},

  abstract={Robotics is now increasingly popular in the education system worldwide as it is one of the core technology enablers for Industry 4.0. Robotics is deemed to be able to promote students' STEM interest and 21st century skills. However, not all the students have the access to robotics, especially in Sibu, East Malaysia. This research presents the implementation of a low-cost Maker Uno educational robotics kit and its associated learning experience of the learners, which were seventy-six Foundation in Science (FIS) students in University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS). The aim of this study is to investigate the students' empirical STEM robotics learning experience by offering them an opportunity to explore a low-cost self-assembled robotics car. Questionnaire and interviews that constitute a mixed method research were employed to investigate the present situation and derive at a solution to the problem. The findings showed that the proposed robotics activities were beneficial for the students to exercise 21st century skills and cultivate STEM interests. Educators could potentially benefit from applying this robotics pedagogical exemplary to help the students to cultivate STEM interests and 21st century skills. Future research on innovation exemplary, particularly on low-cost robotics applications and robotics education methods can be explored.},

  title={Making Figures for Class Materials Using KETpic Based on Symbolic Thinking}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={93-101},
  abstract={Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.},

  year={2019},
  volume={23},
  number={6},
  pages={935-948},
  abstract={The cooperative coevolution (CC) framework achieves a promising performance in solving large scale global optimization problems. The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art CC frameworks.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to "adapt" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on "learning" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether "enabling" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors.},

  abstract={This paper examines the assembly of interdisciplinary teams in emerging scientific fields. We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.},

  abstract={Scaling of simulations challenges the effectiveness of conventional visualization methods. This problem becomes two-fold for mesoscale weather models that operate in near-real-time at cloud-scale resolution. For example, typical approaches to vector field visualization (e.g., wind) are based upon global methods, which may not illustrate detailed structure. In addition, such computations employ multi-resolution meshes to capture small-scale phenomena, which are not properly reflected in both vector and scalar realizations. To address the former critical point analysis and simple bandpass filtering of wind fields is employed for better seed point identification of streamline calculations. For the latter, an encapsulation of nested computational meshes is developed for general realization. It is then combined with the seed point calculation for an improved vector visualization of multi-resolution weather forecasting data.},

The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.},

  abstract={Presents a scalable algorithm for short-range molecular dynamics which minimizes interprocessor communications at the expense of a modest computational redundancy. The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>},

Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.},

  abstract={The pace of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to healthcare has been speeding up. Many of the initiatives have been technology driven aiming at finding problems matching the new technology while systematic, demand driven search for solutions has been limited. Here we describe the process of identifying opportunities for deploying artificial intelligence to healthcare and social services on regional and national levels in Finland. The process includes idea generation and elaboration using a design thinking method complemented with architectural design for identifying required AI capabilities for the 34 best use cases. In this paper, we focus on the development of use case “Mobile Solution for Home Care Coordination and Communication” to observe the evolving balance of technology push and demand pull faced in the process.},

  abstract={Holon is a powerful metaphor which captures the recursive structure of biological systems and the organization of their decision processes arranged at various granularity abstraction levels. From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings.},

  abstract={Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.},

  abstract={Supply chain network design is a critical strategic challenge that significantly influences operational efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace. This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost. The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to disruptions and strong generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from medium-sized problems to larger, unseen instances.},

  abstract={In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency. EPM and ITS can also contribute to AI and cognitive informatics, helping to develop autonomous reasoning system for person-centered learning and training to predicative competence and decision making.},

  abstract={A new class of genetic algorithms (GA) is presented. It is based on the idea of outsourcing, a popular trend in business. In a human based genetic algorithm (HBGA), all primary genetic operators are outsourced, i.e. delegated to external human agents. A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.},
