  abstract={Technologies are growing rapidly and its applications are enormous in different strata of society. In this paper especially we are talking about educational technologies. We could see there is a significant change in elementary and secondary education over the past 10 years like classroom teaching, information and communications technology (ICT), and now everything is all about the cloud computing. Cloud computing technologies play a big role in the development of educational technologies. CT-Blocks is a virtual private cloud system developed for K-12 schools. The importance of the word computational thinking makes everyone to the development of educational tools to impart computational thinking to primary, middle and high school students. CT-Blocks is a cloud and block based programming language that reinforces the word computational thinking in all types of users.},

  abstract={Many technology and design-based disciplines are facing increasing demands to prepare students to perform effectively within computational and simulation environments. Further, students' spatial abilities are an important prerequisite to technological literacy within virtual environments. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities teaching a large group of first-year, interdisciplinary students to apply spatial thinking skills by undertaking a team-based, design project using an industrial-strength computational design environment (SolidWorks). We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being “lost” in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks.},

  title={Instilling Computational Thinking in Undergraduate Students Across Multiple Disciplines through an Adaptive Gamified e-Learning Platform}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.},

  abstract={This paper exhibits a systematic literature mapping of the considerations required to develop algorithmic thinking in a first course in computer programming (CS1) in university academic programs in computing. In the methodological process of this study, 5 stages were proposed: research questions, search, selection, quality assessment and synthesis extraction. In this way, 5 guiding questions were drawn, 136 articles generated by the search stage were analyzed and the synthesis of 55 documents that met the criteria of this research was concluded, thus compiling the different practices used for the development of algorithmic thinking. In addition, as a result of the systematic literature mapping, a definition of Algorithmic Thinking oriented Software Engineering and didactics is proposed.},

  title={Developing the computational thinking process in Physics courses, an empirical study for the learning of the rigid body concept in engineering students},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In the present Research-to-practice Full-paper, the learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes, in engineering students, have been analyzed from different approaches, one of them is the computational thinking process, where most of the activities must be performed as a computer does and the reasoning is developed with the well-oriented activities realized by them. In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.},

  abstract={With the worldwide momentum of promoting computational thinking (CT) education, greater attention has been received on assessing learning effects in both cognitive and attitudinal aspects. However, the cross-lagged relations between the two were unknown. This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education.},

  abstract={We developed and piloted a new course titled Computer Science Teaching Methods (CSM) in the fall semester of 2019. This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother.},

  abstract={This study originates from the content synthesis of studies on computational thinking, need assessment, gamification, and computational thinking with coding from Thai and international scholarly articles published in accredited databases. Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered an important skillset for 21st century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in the recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. There have been various approaches to teach computational thinking in early education stages that utilize modern technologies, such as physical computing and robotics, and adopt a playful manner. Mobile Augmented Reality is a promising technology along this path that lets users collaborate and interact with both physical and digital elements. However, the technology is still relatively new and has not been studied extensively with students, especially in formal educational settings. In this paper we present ARQuest, a collaborative mobile augmented reality game for developing computational thinking skills of primary school students. The game combines a physical board and tangible tokens with animated 3D content, and students use them to create and solve challenges in a gamified environment. We have performed an exploratory study in two primary schools in order to explore the impact of ARQuest on students' understanding of algorithmic concepts, engagement and collaboration. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the game, as well as more generic aspects of interacting and collaborating in mobile augmented reality.},

  abstract={Recently, higher education has seen an increasing emphasis on the prominent role of computational thinking in all disciplines. Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets},

  abstract={As Virtual reality (VR) devices become more widespread, they are being recognized as efficient teaching tools for many subjects. In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion. In the post-survey, most participants acknowledge that the immersive environment is helpful when learning abstract subjects.},

  abstract={Drones have emerged as powerful educational tools, offering students diverse ways to learn and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in STEM education. Drones are framed within real-world contexts, showcasing their applications in multiple industries. Drones offer the possibility to be used to teach programming and coding that promote computational and critical thinking. This research paper presents a pedagogical approach that combines the use of drones with inquiry-based learning to foster students' intellectual, creative, and technical abilities, enhancing their understanding of real-world scenarios and their capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving. The study was conducted in top-end schools in Northern Australia. The findings indicate that engaging in drone coding exercises within authentic bushfire scenarios offers an ideal environment for STEM education, enhancing students' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.},

  abstract={The employment of technology as a tool is a reality in any area of knowledge. Technology is present and permanently impacts our society, including its effects on education. Computational thinking is a way of critically and creatively using the fundamentals of computer science to solve problems, making it essential for success in the job market. This article aims to stimulate computational thinking in children from the first years of elementary school, ranging from the 1 st to the 5 th grades, which corresponds to the age group from 6 to 10 years old. For developing computational thinking in the students, a didactic sequence was created using several tools, namely: naval battle, Blockly Games and the Scratch block programming language. The sequence of artifacts created with Scratch simulates a robot with color sensors, and, as students progress in learning, new challenges are added with the use of sensors, sounds and animations. This project aims to show the importance of computational thinking and encourage teachers to make it increasingly present in the classroom.},
