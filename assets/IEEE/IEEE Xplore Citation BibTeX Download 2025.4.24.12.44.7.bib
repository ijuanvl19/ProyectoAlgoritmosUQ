  abstract={With the appearance of 2D graphical user interfaces in the 1980s, users began to carry out most operations on 2D icon-based interfaces instead of using line-based terminals. With the emergence of smartphones in the 2010s, the notion of portable 2D graphical user interfaces was born, and by today, users accessing digital services are no longer tethered to a single location. All of these advances have led to immense changes in our conceptualization of digital information systems, the effects of which are difficult to overestimate. Recent developments in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to lead to the next major breakthrough in this series of cognitive expansions, bringing to the forefront portable, context-aware spatial interfaces. A consequence of these developments is that users are expecting to be able to access a growing multitude and variety of digital content in ways that are increasingly contextualized and personalized, i.e., relevant to the time, location and topic from the perspective of the users’ personal history. In this paper, we propose an adaptive content labeling and storage model that is suitable to these challenges. Our model, called the Graph-Indexed Tensor Store (GITS) has the benefits of being adaptive and personalized, while also allowing for content retrieval to be carried out based on associative search operations. In a preliminary analysis of the model, we address the challenges of what we refer to as syntactic, semantic and pragmatic saturation, and provide ways to quantity and further explore their effects.},

  abstract={Individuals aged 20 years and over are considered. We identified participants as having diabetes if they had a HbA1c level greater than 6.5 %. People with diabetes who say they do not actually obtain care is deemed to be untreated for the purposes of this research. In this research, we used logistic regression to assess which risk factors were correlated with untreated diabetes. The aim of Review Machine learning (ML) is to diagnose, cure, and prevent diabetes. While a number of ML models have been created, they are not relevant to real- world scenarios yet. There has been a significant disconnect between ML architects, health care researchers, physicians, and patients in their technologies. Our aim is to perform an in-depth analysis on ML to recognize the potential and shortcomings of the technology. Recent advances in the development of insulin delivery devices, diabetes retinopathy diagnostic methods, and other medical studies have significantly helped people diagnosed with diabetes. Compared with these, the usage of statistical methods for diabetes treatment is only at an early level. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs several highly creative ideas to get their drugs to the consumer. Description ML offers a fantastic chance to handle diabetes with improved strategies and technology.},

  abstract={TikTok has rapidly become the most popular social media application which offers creative and entertaining features. However, its excessive consumption carries the risk of addiction along with significant distraction. Multiple studies have found that the use of social media has also been linked to an increase in the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and suicide ideation. The aim of this research is to identify and investigate the potential destructive impact of TikTok on society, specifically on the mental health and well-being of young people. This study quantitatively evaluates the data collected from an online survey distributed to a large number of young Tiktok users. The study explored the nature and extent of TikTok usage among young individuals and examined the potential impacts of TikTok usage on mental health outcomes. The researchers have found that gender differences linked to self-assessment, addiction and the fear of missing out (FOMO) could lead to more anxiety, depression and worsen self-esteem. However, pressure for higher visibility support creativity and skill development while longer TikTok usage leads to addiction as in the case of other social media platforms.},

  abstract={The results of enormous climate change and other industrial carbon emissions have been driven by the rise of nonrenewable traditional energy sources. The scientific community is looking at unconventional renewable techniques that can harvest energy in the external atmosphere. This research article provides a critical analysis of the growth in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting. Recent advances in bio-inspired piezo-smart equipment are critically analyzed. A comprehensive overview of harvesting power from mechanical vibrations and its renewable sources, such as human body movements, flowing fluid, and circuitry arrangements of structures with piezoelectric materials have been discussed. Capturing and converting mechanical energy into useful electric power is the easiest and most prevalent way to harness the massive amounts of ambient energy around us. With the help of piezoelectric materials, vibrations induced by mechanical sources can convert into electrical energy. Various industries, including transportation, construction, aeronautical, smart systems, micro-fluids, biomedical devices, and implantable electronics, employ piezoelectric energy generating at the micro level. Piezoelectric energy generating technique’s applications along with their achievements, and future possibilities are critically analyzed. This overview concisely presents the extensive range of piezoelectric materials for wireless electronic devices that use eco-friendly, renewable, and sustainable energy harvesting sources.},

  abstract={The main objective of human resource management (HRM) is to deploy workers in any company in an efficient manner. Strategies for human resource management may involve putting in place policies aimed at reducing the psychological burden of work. Most businesses, especially service providers, consider music in the hopes that it will increase output and morale. Fewer experts have examined the effect of music on employee motivation, especially in manufacturing companies. This study examines the role of vocal music art in employees (RVMAE) in order to assess how ambient music affects Sri Lankan employees' performance. The primary goal of the hypothesis was to determine the effects of music listening. The sample size for this study is fifty male equipment workers, with a median age of sixty-four. Two data collection periods are made possible by distributing an equal number of structured questionnaires before and after music performance. That group listened to calming music for two months. Regression analysis and average results have been used to the data analysis. According to research, incorporating sound effects into a workspace greatly increases output. The study's conclusions include the following recommendations: play music at a fast tempo, talk to staff, play more music, consider their opinions, and change the subject to suit the occasion. According to this study, creating a nice work atmosphere with ambient music may increase worker productivity even more. When compared to alternative approaches, the testing results demonstrate that the RVMAE model achieves a Mood Enhancement Ratio of 24%, a Reduction of Stress Distress and Agitation Ratio of 37%, an Increase in Relaxation Levels of 24%, Access to 1:1 time of 26%, Prolonged Effects of 29%, and an Enjoyment Ratio of 38%.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The incorporation of virtual reality (VR) technologies and digital narratives is causing a revolution in the manner in which current English literature deals with the concept of lying. The purpose of this investigation is to investigate how digital platforms and immersive virtual reality environments are altering narrative forms. These platforms are enabling authors to create interactive, multi-sensory gests that go beyond the bounds of traditional storytelling. The study shows the evolving link between compendiums and narratives by studying significant exemplifications from a recent erudite workshop. The study also stresses the importance of followership participation and engagement as central components of this relationship. This article dives into the theoretical frameworks that support this transformation, taking into consideration the counterarguments for narrative structure, character development, and thematic expression. In a similar vein, the investigation analyzes how these creations present a challenge to traditional erudite analysis and interpretation, so providing new pathways for investigating meaning in literary works. The ultimate objective of this study is to explain how virtual reality (VR) and digital narratives are not only transforming how stories are told but also how they are schooled, which may lead to a reevaluation of the future of scholarly discourse in the digital age.},

  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly creating a place for themselves in society. There are numerous reports, both good and bad, of their use in business, academia, government and society. While some organizations are trying to limit, or eliminate, their use, it appears that it is inevitable they will become a common “tool”. In education, there is a fear that students will not acquire critical thinking in the future, but we argue that LLMs will become a tool to assist students with critical thinking, giving guidance, feedback, and assessment. This paper investigates how the current state of LLMs can be integrated into modeling and simulation (M&S) education. Example cases for modeling and simulation development are presented showing how an LLM can assist M&S design and education in anticipation of LLMs becoming a common tool for M&S practitioners. Current limitations are also highlighted, and where possible, short-term solutions are proposed.},

  abstract={This work investigates the complications of robotic learning using reinforcement learning (RL). While RL has enormous potential for solving complex tasks its major caveat is the computation cost- and time-intensive training procedure. This work aims to address this issue by introducing a humanlike thinking and acting paradigm to a RL approach. It utilizes model-based deep RL for planning (think) coupled with inverse kinematics (IK) for the execution of actions (act). The approach was developed and tested using a Franka Emika Panda robot model in a simulated environment using the PyBullet physics engine Bullet. It was tested on three different simulated tasks and then compared to the conventional method using RL-only to learn the same tasks. The results show that the RL algorithm with IK converges significantly faster and with higher quality than the applied conventional approach, achieving 98%, 99% and 98% success rates for tasks 1-3 respectively. This work verifies its benefit for use of RL-IK with multi-joint robots.},

We present a principled approach to teach programming using a debugging game called Gidget, which was created using a unique set of seven design principles. A total of 44 teens played it via a lab study and two summer camps. Principle by principle, the results revealed strengths, problems, and open questions for the seven principles. Taken together, the results were very encouraging: learners were able to program with conditionals, loops, and other programming concepts after using the game for just 5 hours.},

  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  abstract={This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML.},

  abstract={Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.},

One group used physical robots in their lessons to complete programming assignments, while the other group used robot simulators. We are interested in finding out if there is any difference in the learning gain and experiences between those that use physical robots as compared to robot simulators. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of students' learning between the two approaches. However, the control group that uses the physical robot shows a more positive response in their attitudes towards computing. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to engaging students and challenges in using physical robots from the learner perspectives and ways to alleviate this. Finally, by considering the insights from students' comments, we also suggest an alternative that may give both benefits of using both physical robots and robot simulators.},

  abstract={Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions.},

  abstract={Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.},

  abstract={Recursion is a powerful conceptual tool, nevertheless it is often considered too abstract and technical to be effectively proposed in lower secondary school. Here we present our experience in introducing 8th graders to recursive strategies where the active observation of recursive algorithms execution allowed pupils to understand the main features of a recursive process, to convince themselves that it works, and to unveil the mystery of its effectiveness. In fact, by focusing on the self-similarity of the input data and the possibility to delegate blindly the solution of subproblems, pupils were able to recognize the heuristic potential of recursion. We started with an unplugged activity using LEGO bricks where a recursive algorithm was executed by pupils, and we continued with an activity supported by a software tool we developed ad-hoc. The undertaking was concluded by the abstract consolidation of the basic concepts and properties which had come out during the previous activities.},

  abstract={In order to strengthen the interest of students in the field of programming, robots are increasingly being used in courses of study with information technology content. This article describes the use of the robot Vector, manufactured by Anki, in a controlled laboratory experiment with undergraduate students. The aim of the research was to investigate the influence of robots on the motivation of programming beginners from the perspective of the students. The data of the study was collected using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The subsequent analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and Chi2-tests. In addition, a computer-aided content analysis as well as a factor analysis was used as a second evaluation method. The research results showed a consistently positive influence of the Vector robot on the motivational behavior of the students. In particular, significant dependencies between the female gender and individual subcategories of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory could be demonstrated. The generalization of the research results is limited due to the small sample size and the exclusive participation of programming beginners.},

  abstract={Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives.},

  abstract={This Full Paper of Innovative Practice research shows results that could help to avoid some challenges faced by those who seek to learn how to program. To help improve learning, educators need a deep understanding of the obstacles students must overcome; otherwise, teaching strategies will be uncertain. Moreover, a shallow understanding of topics learned in introductory programming courses can negatively influence the learning of future topics. With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially. The main contribution of this paper is a theory that describes the connections among topics of learning how to program, showing the influence that knowledge about one can have on others.},

  abstract={Coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech world. At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized. In conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to have positive consequences in the programming learning process, providing a starting point for the development of a tool that contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics found and analyzed in this document.},

  title={Massive Remote School Trips: A Case Study},

  abstract={During the height of the CoViD-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, schools throughout Europe have been closed for several months, leaving teachers with the responsibility of providing distance learning through video conferencing and remote-presence systems, while parents were scrambling for appropriate tools and support. School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the “CodyTrip” event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. Findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism.},
