  abstract={The solution consists in creating a new curriculum for the topics of computing in schools that will focus on a didactic teaching so that students can develop computer thinking. It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.},

  abstract={Models of the cognitions used by engineering students to solve problems have always been a part of engineering education. Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.},

  abstract={In the area of testing ICs, once an IC has failed a traditional go/no-go test, it needs to be tested further to determine if it can support error-tolerant operation for one or more high volume customers. This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004). Digital systems designers have almost always focused on the concept of exact computational capability. Error-tolerant VLSI chips are a step in this direction using today's technologies, addressing current computational needs, and accepting present realities of scale and yield.},

  abstract={Constructing a realistic systems biology of the mammalian cell will require us to describe molecular and cellular "parts", and to model and simulate their relationships in space and time. To date, most modelling and simulation has focused on temporally dynamic processes including pathways of gene regulation, metabolism and cellular signalling. A goal of the Visible Celltrade project is to integrate spatial as well as temporal models within a common data, computational and visualisation environment to support hypothesis-generation and hypothesis-testing by biologists and modellers. A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services. The Visible Celltrade has been designed as an e-research project and implements computational and data grid standards and technologies.},

  abstract={Although deep learning models are powerful among various applications, most deep learning models are still a black box, lacking verifiability and interpretability, which means the decision-making process that human beings cannot understand. Therefore, how to evaluate deep neural networks with explanations is still an urgent task. In this paper, we first propose a multi-semantic image recognition model, which enables human beings to understand the decision-making process of the neural network. Then, we presents a new evaluation index, which can quantitatively assess the model interpretability. We also comprehensively summarize the semantic information that affects the image classification results in the judgment process of neural networks. Finally, this paper also exhibits the relevant baseline performance with current state-of-the-art deep learning models.},

  abstract={A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.},

  abstract={Problem-solving in the industry requires a broad perspective, adequate IT and engineering knowledge, open and creative thinking. This involves many areas that IT specialists and engineers need to acquire skill in finding and selecting problems, splitting complex issues into parts, exploring history, finding the right solution alternatives, selecting and optimizing, controlling the solution, and developing a conceptual plan. In our research, we aimed to examine one of the key competences of the 21st century, the problem-solving competence of engineering and IT higher education students. The research presented in the study is an element of a complex higher education competence test. Quantitative research has been done with an online measuring tool, a problem-solving questionnaire consisting of 16 items. The questions examine some elements of the problem-solving process.},

  abstract={Insitut Teknologi Del (IT Del), formerly recognized as Politeknik Informatika Del (PI Del), has consistently maintained its emphasis on the computing curriculum, establishing it as the institution's primary domain of expertise since its founding. Being recognized as a campus with its high employability rate, this paper aims to describe how IT Del develops its computing curriculum in connection to its involvement in the Decart project. This paper first presents the Indonesia curriculum guideline. This is followed by the discussion of the development process of computing curriculum emphasizing three components: knowledge, skills, and dispositions. The last component is believed to be one of the important components aimed to prepare graduates to have 21st century skills. Then we relate them to the involvement of IT Del in the DECART project, funded by Erasmus Mundus. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that our existing curriculum development approach has been successful to build expected graduates' competence. This is expected to give an insight to define an agile curriculum framework to face the VUCA world as one of the objectives for the DECART project.},

  abstract={Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.},

  abstract={With the growing need for STEM workers in the job market, schools tend to look for extra-curricular activities that promote this type of skills. With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.},

  pages={2446-2459},
  abstract={This paper presents a graph processing based traffic estimation system, GPTE, which is able to achieve high accuracy and high scalability to support city scale traffic estimation. GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

  abstract={Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

  abstract={This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.},

  abstract={Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.},

  abstract={The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.},

  abstract={Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={The testability of equipment has become the key factor affecting equipment availability, and detracts from readiness and mission success. To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.},

  abstract={Situation assessment in interactions needs to make an explicit evaluation of the social interactions. When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.},
