  title={Teachers' Intention to Integrate Computational Thinking Skills in Higher Education: A Survey Study in the Netherlands}, 
  year={2024},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy.},

  title={Constructing a Computational Thinking Evaluation Framework for Pupils}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={6},
  pages={878-888},
  abstract={Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning. Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring. Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills. Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework. Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.},

  abstract={The contribution of this paper is the introduction of an abstract sensor-actuator pair to the subsumption architecture of robots introduced by Brooks (1987). The perceiving side of this pair derives from Gibson's (1979) affordance, which is a form of grasping of situations involving perceived objects. This study is part of a new form of evolutionary robotics called cognitive robotics. It considers a new context for a classical form of learning, namely, habitation. The inspiration for the form of affordances described in this paper comes from Heidegger's (1982) notion of the convergence of the concurrent activities of building, dwelling and thinking. In some sense, building and dwelling are at the threshhold of thinking. A brief description of the form and functioning of abstract S-A pairs is given.},

  abstract={Efforts to broaden participation in computing have revealed the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of how girls of color form computing identities. In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential.},

We consider how a developing computational theory of cognition can be used to monitor and manage interactions with and within complex systems and so harness unwanted and emergent states and behaviours before the computational system becomes dysfunctional. A comparison is made between these emergent computational states and emotional states. The opening scenario provides a global systems context for the interaction between man and the cyber-domain. The final focus of the paper weaves these threads together in a consideration of the nature of goals, emotion and philosophical issues related to (computational) modelling.},

The sample was 111 students who worked in two experimental groups and in a control group. The evaluation of the development of variational thinking was carried out according to covariational reasoning. The results show that the application of the strategy allowed the development of variational thinking because it significantly improved the level of covariational reasoning, allowing students to develop and strengthen skills to coordinate the amount of change in the variables.},

  abstract={One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python. The MindReader system is able to assess student assignments and guide them how to develop correct and better code in real time without human assistance.},

  abstract={More than one third of computer science students either switch disciplines or fail the first programming class due to test/performance anxiety or learning difficulties. Personalized feedback can potentially improve both learning outcomes and retention for novice learners of computer programming. Online learning management and assessment systems have the power to allow self-paced, individualized and multi-layered learning that can be easily combined with time tested learning strategies such as pair programming, game based learning or visual programming to positively impact learning outcomes and support free-choice learning. In this paper, we introduce an online automated tutoring and assessment system, called MindReader, for introductory programming in C++. We discuss how MindReader generates personalized feedback fully automatically and prioritizes semantic error messages to avoid overwhelming the learner with a large number of signs of “failures.” We also discuss how MindReader can be used as a flexible teaching tool for introductory programming classes, and how its smart tutoring and assessment systems can improve learning.},

In light of this, the work-in-progress study employed a semester-long intervention to explore the role of BPNS in students’ CT skill development.

  abstract={To address pattern classification problems without involving complex computations, a Hash-Based Convolutional Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier (HCDTPC) has been developed. This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes. The simulation section assesses the performance of the HCDTPC, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in pattern classification.},

The combination of these approaches provides a better understanding of the scenario alternatives available to decision makers. This is, recognizing the context of the focal question with creative scenario plots that show the interaction between its key drivers. Therefore, the hybrid model, should be useful to unify the strategic point of view by recognizing the most plausible scenario, while reducing the uncertainty due to ambiguous value judgments by Key Decision Makers (KDMs).The work presented in this article aims to develop hybrid model by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to engage a new non-linear form of systems thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental case that develops a case for rethinking the ideas of a research system for a local organization.The article ends with a reflection on outcomes and suggests ways for future research.},

  title={Physical and Digital Twin with Computational Thinking to Foster STEM Vocations in Primary Education}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking is a core capability for most engineers. The term summarizes a set of skills needed to transform real-life challenges into problems that can be solved with the help of a computer and to apply computer-based solutions to questions at hand. This mindset is fundamental to almost every engineering task. However, teaching Computational Thinking is a great challenge for educators worldwide. In designing and implementing university curricula, one has to take an increasing number of arguments into consideration. Technological progress requires the design, creation, and analysis of increasingly large and complex systems. Engineering working environments and tasks demand interdisciplinary teams and close communication between involved groups. In designing engineering curricula, these factors need to be considered and the necessary skills must be implicitly or explicitly developed. This paper highlights three examples of classes and projects aimed at enabling students to develop and increase Computational Thinking through systematic introduction of computational tools. From these successful case studies, the paper derives six best practices for fostering Computational Thinking in engineering education. A review of several examples is given, that are used to highlight and extract best practices. This provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships and simplifies the application of the aforementioned principles to course and curriculum designs.},

  abstract={This paper explores the potential for simplified programming languages to support the development of computational thinking skills in nonprogrammers. We suggest that novice programming languages might offer a starting point for nonprogrammers to engage with a substantial subset of computational thinking concepts, and assess a number of languages from this perspective. We outline four key computational thinking skills and examine the support provided by existing languages. We then describe additional characteristics which would be important for a new language aimed specifically at developing computational thinking skills.},

  abstract={This paper offers a short summary and critical review of the forthcoming book "AI-Driven Research Intelligence: Integrating 3C Theory from Foundational Abilities to Advanced Research Thinking". The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has transformed scientific research, prompting the need for theories on human-AI collaboration. This book introduces the 3C Theory, which integrates AI with human cognition, emotion, and research thinking (critical thinking, creative thinking, and computational thinking). Within the 3C theoretical model, AI not only as a research tool but as an enhancer of human cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and research thinking. By comparing 3C Theory with existing models, the book highlights its potential to transform research processes and support the design of intelligent Human-AI research systems. Additionally, this paper explores the prospects of intelligent research system design, proposing new avenues for research innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and Human-AI interaction.},

  abstract={Computational literacies are becoming increasingly necessary for full societal participation. This paper investigates how Latine and multilingual students leverage their linguistic and cultural resources to develop coding and literacy skills. Data included interviews with Latine and multilingual students, teacher interviews, and teacher co-design meeting notes. Results showed that students learned coding and language through their families and communities, leveraged their cultural knowledge of storytelling to engage in computing, and built self-efficacy through peer support. Findings from this pilot study shed light on how to mobilize Latine and multilingual students’ rich languages and cultures for equitable computer science learning.},
