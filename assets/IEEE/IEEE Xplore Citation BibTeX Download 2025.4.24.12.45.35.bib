  abstract={Sri Lanka has taken the initiative through its new education reforms to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a compulsory content in the ICT curriculum of lower secondary education from 2025. This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants’ interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.},

  abstract={Among the rapidly emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, Generative AI (GenAI) models have become powerful tools reshaping the technology landscape. The term GenAI refers to a shift in the usage of AI technology from pattern recognition—identifying hidden patterns—to creating free-form text, images, and videos. This paper intends to provide a comprehensive review of GenAI applications in various human-centric applications, technology and innovation, creative industries, finance, and accounting. However, the proliferation of GenAI introduces risks and challenges, including ethics, privacy, and security. By elucidating GenAI’s advantages and disadvantages, envisioning future directions, and proposing measures, this study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on harnessing GenAI’s capabilities to mitigate risks. Moreover, this paper delves into the multifaceted role and challenges faced by these GenAI technologies in various domains. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, we can steer towards a future where GenAI enriches lives, stimulates creativity, and empowers individuals and communities worldwide.},

  abstract={Software development has undergone a paradigm change with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into DevOps processes. This study examines the complex effects of AI on every stage of the software development lifecycle, from the creation of the code to its deployment and use. Through the viewpoint of “The Intelligent Evolution of Coding,” we explore how productivity benefits, traditional coding habits are being reshaped, and software is being strengthened against security risks thanks to AI-driven code creation and analysis. After that, the story switches to the revolutionary trip “From CI/CD to Autonomous Pipelines,” explaining how AI is streamlining software releases, improving pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, and encouraging development and operations teams to work together more effectively. The paper highlights the symbiotic connection that characterizes the future of software development by emphasizing the dynamic partnership between human knowledge and machine intelligence throughout this research. To fully realize the promise of AI-driven DevOps, businesses must negotiate this disruptive environment with careful attention to ethical implementation, workforce upskilling, and the development of learning ecosystems.

  pages={265-270},
  abstract={Teachers are individuals who have an important role in the world of education and learning. They not only convey knowledge, but also guide, inspire, and shape students' character and moral values. One of the main problems is subjectivity in judgment, where evaluations made by observers can be influenced by personal perception. The purpose of research that combines the MAIRCA method and weighting using geometric mean is to develop a multi-criteria decision-making approach that is more accurate, objective, and reliable. The application of a DSS using the MAIRCA method with geometric mean weighting in teacher pedagogy assessment, provides an effective tool for evaluators to assess teacher pedagogy performance more objectively and consistently, by combining quantitative and qualitative analysis. This research is also to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the pedagogical assessment process, as well as provide more meaningful and in-depth feedback to teachers to improve the quality of their teaching. The ranking results show the final value of 0.108905 with the alternative name Teacher RD getting the 1 st rank, the final value of 0.100157 with the alternative name Teacher GH getting the 2nd rank, and the final value of 0.072288 with the alternative name Teacher AN getting the 3rd rank.},

  pages={113199-113212},
  abstract={The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={114},
  number={4},
  pages={114-127},
  abstract={In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS.},

  abstract={Advancement in wireless transmission has enabled the communication among multiple devices all over the world, as well as expanding the frontiers of wireless Internet access. As a result of these advancement, numerous devices are questing for wireless connectivity thereby congesting the existing spectrum. If new measures are not taken to reduce depletion of the reserved radio resource, new allocations of wireless Internet access will be impossible, thereby risking the development of the entire wireless ecosystem. The demands for resourceful spectrum consumption have continually driven researchers and stakeholders in the wireless industry to search for spare radio spectrum to offer affordable and reliable wireless connectivity. The TV broadcasting is not fully utilizing the spectrum in some geographical zone. These TV unused spaces called TV White Spaces (TVWS), are well-thought-out to be the probable future resolutions for unavailability of spectrum. The low frequency band (470 to 694 MHz) of the unutilized TV channel has exceptional broadcast features over extensive distances and enables transmissions through high-rise buildings, trees, and mountains. These features allow the applications of TVWS in Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor network, wireless connectivity, wireless switching, smart grid and cities, automated transportation, and logistics as well as connectivity in cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a study on the advantages and benefits of television white space as an alternative to wireless broadband connectivity.},

  abstract={Expressive performance in classical music plays a crucial role in shaping interpretations of musical pieces. However, existing datasets often provide limited attention to expressive markings in piano performances. This research addresses this gap by developing the Expressive Markings and Emotions 33 (EME33) dataset, which captures expressive piano performances in MIDI format, annotated with dynamic markings, expression markings, and additional emotional expressions. To validate the dataset’s applicability, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is suited to the size of our dataset, to render expressiveness in music. The results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in capturing and reproducing expressive performance, highlighting the potential of the EME33 dataset for future research in music information retrieval.},

  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.},

  pages={187-199},
  abstract={Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.},

  abstract={This work proposes a transformer-based model capable of generating music in its symbolic domain, in a controllable fashion. The ultimate goal of this is to build a system with which people can compose music collaboratively with a computer. Using an NLP model as a base (GPT-2), we take advantage of the similarities across symbolic music representation and written language to build a model capable of conditionally predicting musical sequences. Controllability is achieved without explicit programming for it, and does not require extensive retraining of the model. A study with 939 participants was performed to evaluate this controllability. The results of this suggest the proposed method is indeed effective and can be used to control the generation of music in its symbolic domain. The method itself is flexible to any desired “control”, but this work focuses specifically on the emotion conveyed when one listens to a piece of music.},

  abstract={Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.},

  pages={2660-2673},
  abstract={Recently, various text-to-image generative models have been released, demonstrating their ability to generate high-quality synthesized images from text prompts. Despite these advancements, determining the appropriate text prompts to obtain desired images remains challenging. The quality of the synthesized images heavily depends on the user input, making it difficult to achieve consistent and satisfactory results. This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a more efficient and automated approach to obtaining high-quality synthesized images. The findings indicate that prompt optimization may offer a promising pathway for text-to-image generative models.},

  volume={11},

  pages={56634-56648},
  abstract={Even without hearing or seeing individuals, humans are able to determine subtle emotions from a range of indicators and surroundings. However, existing research on emotion recognition is mostly focused on recognizing the emotions of speakers across complete modalities. In real-world situations, emotion reasoning is an interesting field for inferring human emotions from a person’s surroundings when neither the face nor voice can be observed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal approach for predicting emotion from missing one or more modalities based on attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ self-attention for each unimodal representation to extract the dominant features and utilize the compounded paired-modality attention (CPMA) among sets of modalities to identify the context of the considered individual, such as the interplay of modalities, and capture people’s interactions in the video. The proposed model is trained on the Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (MEmoR) dataset, which includes multimedia inputs such as visual, audio, text, and personality. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 50.63% for the primary emotion group and 42.7% for the fine-grained one. According to the results, our proposed model outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of emotion reasoning.},

  abstract={Neural networks have become foundational in modern technology, driving advancements across diverse domains such as medicine, law enforcement, and information technology. By enabling algorithms to learn from data and perform tasks autonomously, they eliminate the need for explicit programming. A significant challenge in this field is replicating the uniquely human capacity for creativity—envisioning and realizing novel concepts and tangible creations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a leading approach in this effort, are especially notable for synthesizing realistic human facial images. Despite the success of GANs, comprehensive comparative studies of face-generating GAN methodologies are limited. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the scope and capabilities of facial generation, detailing the principles of the original GAN framework, and reviewing prominent GAN variants specifically designed for facial synthesis. Through performance evaluations and fidelity analysis of generated images, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of GAN potential in advancing artificial intelligence creativity through performance evaluations and fidelity analysis of generated images.},

  abstract={The Coding for Liberal Arts project explores the integration of coding into humanities education to develop both digital and disciplinary skills in primary school learners. The project addresses the need to transcend the traditional approach that confines coding to STEM area, overlooking its potential to enhance critical thinking and cross-disciplinary competencies in the liberal arts. The main objective of this research is to investigate how educational robotic can be used as an interdisciplinary teaching tool in subjects such as Italian, History and Geography, promoting technical skills alongside a critical understanding of academic content. The methodology is based on principles of Media Education, Cooperative Learning, Competence-Based Learning and Experiential Learning, and it follows the phases of the Scientific Method. Preliminary findings suggest that students have acquired basic coding skills and demonstrated the ability to apply them in disciplinary contexts, though further practice is needed for more complex applications. The research underscores computational thinking's transformative potential as a bridge between technical expertise and critical thinking in the humanities, illustrating that its integration into liberal arts not only boosts digital competencies but also supports cognitive development, providing a comprehensive approach to modern education.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are ubiquitous in our modern world, from the cars we drive to the homes we live in. CPS are integrated systems that combine computational and physical components to perform complex tasks. As CPS become increasingly sophisticated and interconnected, it is important for students to have a basic understanding of how they work and how to use them safely and responsibly.In this work, the need for CPS education, the requirements from the teaching faculty and students, the course design methodology and its intent and a 20-hour lesson plan for CPS education is proposed along with a methodology to teach an introductory module on safety and security. CPS education in pre-university education should be comprehensive and hands-on, with an interdisciplinary approach, emphasis on safety and security, real-world applications, and integration of emerging technologies. This education will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological world while being aware of the trust, safety and security aspects in designing and using the CPS interface. The proposed method was implemented in an undergraduate program as an elective course and its observations are presented.},

  abstract={This study seeks to develop a model that would facilitate professional skill development in aeronavigation system operators by considering the neurophysiology that underlies the formation and development of functional systems. A key role is played by motivation which is realized by electrochemical processes in synapses. We present a model of synapse formation in the process of learning. A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.},

  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in optimizing cumulative rewards, and it provides policies that account for how the system will interact over the future with the agent. However, when more than one learning agents are present, developing efficient collaborations/interactions is a challenging issue; not every agent may have access to the same amount of information and computational resources; not every agent may make the same assumptions about the decision-making mechanisms of one another; and many agents may not even be aware of the existence of other agents. These cognitive and physical limitations can be seen as a form of bounded rationality. Several recent experimental and empirical studies have found that the initial responses of decision-makers in multi-player games are often far from the equilibrium, which is very often out-predicted by structural non-equilibrium (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) models. This is because non-equilibrium play models allow for players who are boundedly rational and have limited information, so that their policy is not necessarily a best response to the actual adjustment laws of other agents. This tutorial talk will present computationally and communicationally efficient approaches for decision-making in boundedly rational stochastic games. Motivated by the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose non-equilibrium strategies, two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning will be described. In the first model, named level-k thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs, and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, this tutorial talk will present both a level-recursive as well as a level-paralleled algorithm, where the latter can have an overall reduced computational complexity. For more information please see the main tutorial paper [1].},

  abstract={A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.},

  abstract={Recently, the realization of transformation method from whisper voice to voice sounds is expected. We easily think of the method using PARCOR analysis when we consider this method. This method is as follows: 1) The vocal tract characteristic is estimated by using the PARCOR analysis. 2) The voice sounds can be generated from the whisper voice by convoluting a periodic pitch with the estimated vocal tract characteristic. However, in 1), this method needs a lot of computational complexity to estimate the vocal tract characteristic. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of vocal tract characteristic with a little computational complexity using the blind estimation based on over sampling instead of PARCOR analysis method.},

  abstract={One from the most difficult tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to analyze poetry, which uses a different genre of language than that considered by computer-based techniques. Therefore, computational analysis is an interesting task when we use NLP in poetry, but it is also challenging. There are a number of researchers that entered this field from NLP and they got promising results using mathematical analysis for poetry, including rhythm analysis. In this paper we focused on providing solution for automating the rhythm detection of the Arabic poems and finding the number of rhythm for each verse in poem and the total percentage for each rhythm in all verses of poem, additional to other characteristics for the Arabic poem like percentage of mobile letter in Arabic “harf mutaharrik”, and The quiescent letter, in Arabic “harf sakin”, In spite of the number of studies in the computational analysis of poetry, we think it needs more, not only to make a better understanding of domain but also in developing applications, considering different literary tastes and the psychological effects, to give a recommendation to the readers and in plagiarism detection[1].},
