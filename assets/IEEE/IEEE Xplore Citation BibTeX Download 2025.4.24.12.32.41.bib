  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming, which is programming by end users with limited, if any, formal programming background, is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end users. More recent approaches include visual programming with drag-and-drop style of programming making it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Future Trace, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to visualize discrepancies between the programs users intended to write and the actual programs.},

  abstract={This work reports an innovative product-based pedagogy that was developed by incorporating entrepreneurial education into the upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in the Electrical Engineering department at the University of Texas (UT) at Tyler. Several aspects make this work different from existing research. We adopted an iterative challenge-based STAR cycle and investigated the effectiveness of computational thinking in our course projects. In addition, entrepreneurial components were incorporated into a series of senior and graduate-level courses with the goal of creating student entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurship-focused curriculum encouraged students to participate in regional pitch competitions and conference presentations. The findings from this work suggest a positive impact of entrepreneurial learning on student learning outcomes.},

  abstract={The teaching of programming in primary and secondary education has once again revealed the heterogeneity of the ways in which students learn and instructors teach such a capability. Language barriers and technological skills of the involved people are some of the factors that affect the usability and usefulness of educational programming environments. This article presents a gamified programming environment, called Damo's Quest, that supports middle school instructors while they teach programming to students who have little access to computer technology and proficiency in English language. The platform offers a gamified-educational experience, in which students must deal with challenges in fantasy stories (in virtual worlds) by programming various solutions. The usability and perceived usefulness of the first version of this tool have been evaluated by two researchers, who are experts in computational thinking. Although preliminary, the results are highly encouraging.},

Our approach has the benefit of integrating directly with Math, which in turn reinforces the teaching of other STEM subjects as well as non-STEM ones. We report early results of an ongoing trial using a visual computing environment that supports this approach.},

  abstract={The term "Modern Art Teaching and Evaluation Model" describes the systematic incorporation of creative practices, methods, and experiences into traditional academic curricula in order to improve student achievement across the curriculum. The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education. The simulation results demonstrate the system's superior performance in precision, accuracy, efficiency, productivity, learning score, and student performance score.},

  abstract={The jigsaw pedagogy as a student-centered instructional approach has been successfully applied in information technology classrooms, but there is a lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of jigsaw pedagogy in unplugged environments. Therefore, this study combined the jigsaw pedagogy with unplugged activities and verified the teaching effect of such a combination through randomized group experiments. The results of the study showed that the combination of the jigsaw pedagogy and the unplugged activities was more conducive to promoting students' motivation and the development of computational thinking than the unplugged activity alone. Drawing upon the research findings, this study concluded with several implications for teachers to reform information technology classrooms in unplugged environments.},

  pages={163-168},
  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a crucial 21st-century skill, and its integration into K–12 education underscores the need for effective assessment tools. Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices.},

  abstract={When the classical theory of problem solving is put into practice, a sequence of operator applications must be found that transforms an initial problem state into a goal state. This is equivalent to finding a path through the graph of possible problem states from an initial node to a goal node. The search is usually conducted by an algorithm or by a human through an iterative process of selecting and applying operators to states found so far. Here, I demonstrate examples of searching in problem spaces via interactive drawing. The demonstrations help to elucidate issues in the design of new problem-solving affordances that may enhance the abilities of human solvers to understand and solve problems. This opens up new ways to conceptualize the process of solving problems, and it suggests new ways to teach a form of computational thinking.},

  abstract={Personalized learning is a teaching method that tailors learning to each student's specific talents, requirements, abilities, and preferences in order to foster entrepreneurial skills. In personalized education, each student is given a curriculum based on what they already know and how well they understand. To achieve its rapid and productive activity, a large-scale data analysis model for tracking the creative and entrepreneurial skills of college students is dependent on the balance and synergy of aspects such as different learning, finance, and institutional frameworks. As a result, in this research, a Big Data-assisted Thinking Skill Analysis Model (BD-TSAM) is presented to analyze students' innovative thinking skills and improve entrepreneurial skills through tailored education. This study creates a sophisticated and varied learning resource that continuously records and analyses student data. It provides tailored training, personalized learning, and dependable real-time services through technical support that uses big data to increase Entrepreneurship abilities. BD-TSAM enhances students' distinctive social and autonomous entrepreneurship learning by providing adaptive learning services. BD-TSAM intelligently creates a learning paradigm that is appropriate for each student and actually implements tailored learning for instilling entrepreneurial abilities. Comparing the suggested BD-TSAM model to other models already in use, the experimental results demonstrate that it increases the student learning rate by 94.6%, assessment rate by 95.2%, F-measure ratio by 96.6%, student performance ratio by 98.1%, decision-making rate by 99.1%, and employment ratio by 98.9%.},

  abstract={This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.},

  abstract={Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to provide meaningful scaffolding to bachelor humanities students, to enabled them to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) technical skills, and in particular basic programming competences. Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.},

  pages={1-2},
  abstract={A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.},

  abstract={From a scientific perspective explaining how the brain thinks is a big goal. Cognitive informatics studies intelligent behavior from a computational point of view in terms of updated research efforts and processes of brain science and neuroscience. Cognitive informatics is the interdisciplinary study of cognition. Cognition includes mental states and processes, such as thinking, reasoning, remembering, language understanding and generation, visual and auditory perception, learning, consciousness, emotions, etc. In this paper we will point out basic research topics of learning, memory, thought, language, and neural computing which are active fields related to cognitive informatics.},

He puts forward these operators' properties, computational models, and their successful examples in man's creative thinking activities. Several problems concerning the combined use of C* operator are also discussed.},

  abstract={The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.},

  abstract={Mathematics is one of the most difficult courses to study for engineering students. In addition, effective communication, teamwork, and problem solving are important skills for graduate engineers in their professional work. This study proposes Creative Problem Solving as a framework to improve the way engineering students learn mathematics and support their critical problem solving, communication, and team working skills. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using creative problem solving skills through blended learning environment as seen from an Engineering Mathematics students' perspective. First year undergraduate students participated in an experimental group where instruction was provided in a blended learning format using a creative problem solving approach. The lecturer then used face-to-face instruction on the same subject to a control group. Results indicate that from the perspective of the students in the experimental group, the ability to utilize creative problem solving skills is the most important skill set when learning Engineering Mathematics.},
