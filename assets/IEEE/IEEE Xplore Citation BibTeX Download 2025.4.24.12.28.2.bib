  abstract={The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.},

  abstract={In order to overcome the potential problems during design modification and reuse, it is necessary to record the design intent as an explicit part of the design thinking process and execute consistency maintenance of the design thinking process. This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design activities and decisions but also the design intents behind them. Based on this model, two types of inconsistency in design thinking process are identified. The implementation of consistency check and maintenance is based on assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS).},

  abstract={The revival of artificial intelligence (AI) a few years ago has often been attributed to the success of machine learning (ML), especially the branch of ML known as deep learning (DL). Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.},

  abstract={This paper provides insights from a preliminary study on how embedding critical academic literacy skills using active learning strategies in a small Master's level computer science course might impact student performance, skills development, and engagement. One goal of higher education is to develop students' critical thinking and research skills. Prior work suggests these skills are best taught explicitly, when they are embedded in the curriculum, using active learning strategies, and using recent high-quality research as a basis for inquiry. Using multiple methods, this paper examines how teaching critical academic literacy skills through active learning strategies impacts student critical thinking ability and engagement. Results suggest substantial student engagement and improvements in critical literacy skills.},

This paper presents a denotational mathematical structure and methodology for modeling fuzzy qualifications and quantifications in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence. Fuzzy qualifications and quantifications for both absolute and relative measures are formally elaborated on discrete and continuous fuzzy object and expressions. In addition, the qualification for characteristic attributes of fuzzy objects is modeled. Applications of fuzzy qualifications and quantifications are illustrated using a rich set of examples and real-world cases, which enable machines to mimic complex human reasoning mechanisms in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence.},

  abstract={This article develops an instruction method for promoting design innovation capability through a design-based program with identification, modeling, simulation, and prototyping (IMSP). The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) allows us to solve complex problems by expressing it in a way that computers, humans, or both, can understand. CT is closely related to problem solving and critical thinking, which are actively used in STEM education. Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work.},

  abstract={We present a critique of the current teaching practices of simulation. We challenge the current view of simulation, to the extent that most textbooks' contents will be found to be secondary to the missing necessary primary material. We advocate that (simulation) education has four general objectives, which are to teach students how to learn, how to think creatively, how to problem solve, and how to be professionals. These four objectives of education may not be possible to teach. In the words of Oscar Wilde, "Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught". So an education in simulation requires that students be put into learning situations that enable them to learn the requisite knowledge concerning the four objectives.},

  abstract={No design, no business. Higher test score doesn't represent better global competitiveness. Creativity is central to the competitive capabilities of 21st century citizens and thus creativity education should play crucial role for every grade curricular. However, the development of creative potential requires work and incubation over time. It takes more efforts than standard curricula can afford. What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving--the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors. The process of problem awareness, situation perception, idea generation, solution emergence and selection as well as action preparations are elaborated in the story. Pilot testing of target users show a strong positive attitude toward this digital storybook.},

  abstract={In the frames of the process of informatisation of education, the issue of the formation of optimization thinking among high school students has been considered. The formation of this kind of competences cannot be ensured by purely theoretical training; therefore, it is proposed to use models of optimal environmental management as vivid examples of solving optimization problems. The models illustrate such basic optimization concepts as the objective functional, different kinds of constraints, and the formulation of nonlinear and dynamic programming problems. Using the examples of managing the process of forest restoration, the importance of the correct selection of parameters of the model and methods for solving the optimization problem is shown. Concrete examples of using the proposed technique are given.},

  pages={873-879},
  abstract={The increasing development of weak artificial intelligence technology has had a profound impact on the field of design. It not only provides new sources of inspiration for artistic creation, but also makes the constraints of visual communication design more complex. At the same time, media convergence has promoted a strong demand for cross media conversion and diversified output, especially in the process of brand visual innovation, where more and more multimedia elements, dynamic effects, and interactive needs are emerging. Traditional visual design methods are insufficient in this complex design environment, and there is an urgent need to innovate design patterns through new technologies and strategies. Since the concept of "computational design" was proposed, algorithms and programming techniques have gradually become the core tools of modern visual design. Through extensive practice, computational design has not only brought rich changes to brand visual forms, but also developed into a systematic design pattern that can respond to the diversity and dynamism of today's design needs. This study explores the structure and development of computational visual design systems, with a focus on analyzing their potential applications and practical strategies in new retail pet brands. Through in-depth market research, the application opportunities of computational design in brand vision have been revealed, and algorithm based brand vision construction strategies, brand image communication strategies, and community driven visual communication strategies have been proposed. Finally, by combining the actual design case of the "Xiaopei Pet" brand, the effectiveness of these strategies was verified, providing new ideas for innovation in the field of brand visual design and valuable experience for the future development of computational visual design.},

This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to investigate the 32 studies that were published between 2021 and 2024 in order to assess the impact of LLMs on problem solving skills. The review identifies the significant improvements in undergraduates' problem-solving effectiveness, creativity, and computational thinking. It also emphasizes the need for careful implementation of these tools to avoid potential overreliance, which may impact the student's ability to develop independent problem-solving skills. The review identifies the importance of a well-balanced integration of LLMs in education to maximize their benefits while addressing the challenges they present. Recommendations for future research directions are suggested to further explore the long-term impacts of LLMs on the development of problem-solving skills and their applicability across diverse academic environments.},

  abstract={Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.},

  abstract={Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.},

  abstract={Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Computational thinking is central to recent approaches aimed at engaging K-12 students in computer science. Many strategies and metrics have been proposed to foster and measure such skills. The poster presents an empirical study which measures the understanding, recognition and rule construction ability of rising 3rd to 5th grade students from underrepresented communities. This poster also focuses on strategies for engaging students and reflects the importance of a coherent computer science curriculum which includes collaboration and individual activities supported by a graphical tool like Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab.},

  abstract={The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years, which have caused heavy casualties and severe economic losses. It is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via CPS and IoT are discussed. Moreover, the security issue of the proposed system is also analyzed.},

  abstract={The year 2021 is the first year of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, and the year when the country will vigorously develop its independent core technologies attack. The national development strategy has put forward new demands on talent cultivation, and the cultivation of the ability to solve complex problems will certainly be further deepened in the graduation requirements of undergraduates. This paper taking the commercial product engineering thinking path as a clue and the “Von Neumann structure computer model machine” product as an example, the Product Canvas is used to simulate the planning process of products at the beginning of complex engineering problems, and the V model is used to simulate the product design and implementation process of complex engineering problems, so as to reconstruct the teaching content of Principles of Computer Organization course, with a view to deepening the requirements of cultivating college students’ ability to solve complex problems.},

  abstract={Jeannette Wing's seminal computational thinking (CT) paper, published in 2006, set forth CT as not just a way of looking at computational problems, but as an alternative approach to solving everyday problems. We strongly support Wing's assertion. Accordingly, we report the results of our meta-analysis of CT curricular implementations since 2006. Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.},
