  abstract={Computer programming courses are mandatory for many majors. However, the high rate of failures shows that students have difficulties in assimilating the topics. The objective of this research is to understand these difficulties. Analyzing diaries filled out by students and interviews with instructors, we identified difficulties related to language and understanding and some strategies used to mitigate them. The analysis and understanding of the difficulties may support the creation of teaching strategies and tools to facilitate the teaching and learning of computer programming.},

  abstract={This is a full paper in the Innovate Practice category examining a Doctor of Professional Studies (D.P.S.) in Computing program at Pace University which is a specialized degree program designed for active Information Technology (IT) professionals with at least five years of full time experience in the computing field. The first question that guided our research is how is the Pace University D.P.S. program related to other doctoral computing programs in the United States and globally. The second question that guided our inquiry is dissertation topics pursued by graduates in dissertation research, specifically by IT professionals in the Pace University program. To answer this second question, we analyzed the first 114 dissertation abstracts that have been defended at Pace University in the Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems. We used machine learning and natural language processing to determine commonalities among research topics in order to gain an understanding of the topic categories and topic spread produced by the program.},

  abstract={This study aims to explore educational methods for conceptual modeling for novices. The subjects of this study are primarily Grade 9 students in secondary school who are enrolled in compulsory education. This study relies heavily on model-driven development (MDD) and a domain-specific language (DSL). Using MDD, learners are not asked to write code, but rather to create a model to evaluate their model by observing the behavior of the target device. Teachers can control the difficulty of the problems assigned to their students by using a DSL. In this study, we describe our research approach using MDD and a DSL and then show our experiment design and results. We also discuss the qualitative and qualitative effectiveness of UML programming in Technology class for Grade 9 students.},

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought to the fore the need to educate students about AI. The aim is not to keep AI a black box and at the same time to be recognized as a transferable literacy with multiple learning benefits per age group of students. In order to strengthen this perspective, the design of workshops to introduce the basics of artificial intelligence to middle school students according to educational neuroscience principles is presented. With these workshops, the importance of AI literacy is emphasized, and students are given space for hands-on activities. The proposals are based on the axes of perception, representation and reasoning, learning, physical interaction, and social impact and include sections on Introduction to Machine Learning, Machine Learning Application Examples, Supervised Learning, and Training-Test Processes, Unsupervised Learning, and Machine Learning Algorithms.},

  abstract={Worldwide we see an increasing focus on implementing STEM, CT and Educational Robotics, within K-12 curricula and the British BBC and the Danish DR, have provided more than one-million pupils with the micro:bit technology. However, research show that breadboards and circuit diagrams, can be difficult to understand. In this paper, we have evaluated a set of tools and materials - designed to support the teaching of electronics and CT, for use with micro:bits, breadboards and circuit diagrams - by integrating them in a case study of a robotics course for 7th grade primary school pupils (n=21). The tools and materials consist of 3D-printable covers designed to visualize the internal connections of a breadboard, and a new type of circuit diagrams, incorporating visual cues from the these, into their designs. Results show that the tools and materials ease the learning of the breadboard and of how to use and interpret circuit diagrams. Furthermore, the tools and materials, have been made available free of charge.},

  abstract={According to UNESCO, the use of technology in education can enhance the quality of education and increase access to education worldwide. One of the technological devices that has gained popularity in education in recent years is the BBC micro:bit. This device has been used as an educational tool to teach programming and technology to students of all ages. This paper combines a scoping review and bibliometric analysis to map and analyze the literature on the implementation of the BBC micro:bit in primary and secondary education. A total of 274 authors have published 95 documents with an average of 2.88 co-authors per document. The integration of BBC micro:bit in education has allowed for the adoption of various teaching strategies and methodologies, enriching the learning experience of students. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the literature on the BBC micro:bit and its research landscape in an educational context.},

  title={Developing a Real World Escape Room for Assessing Preexisting Debugging Experience of K12 Students}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={521-529},
  abstract={Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience.},

  abstract={The purpose of the REACH (REmote ACcess to smart Home facility) platform is to allow students to learn about basic principles of computer science and software engineering practices, and gain hands-on experience through observable effects of the computing systems in a familiar setting (home). It utilizes virtualization to encourage group collaboration and grants anytime, anywhere access to the smart home facility. It incorporates dynamic binding capability that allows students to either use the sensors and actuators hardware they check out and install locally for development, or to conduct experiments in the smart home facility. Once the development is completed, the programs can be deployed remotely, and students can make observations through web cams strategically situated in the smart home facility and the logs of the system's operations and users' activities. The REACH platform is designed to support a large spectrum of computer science courses, from the equivalence of computer science lab 101, interdisciplinary projects, all the way to research projects in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, and human computer interactions.},

  abstract={The original concept of space has emerged in Paleolithic times from the concept of orientation. Its appearance cannot be interpreted as a random event, but it must be seen as the result of considerable brainwork. Current operational structures of cognition appear rooted in prehistoric thought. Pictograms, ideograms and logograms signify fundamental steps for the later emergence of the linear writing and linear time as history and thought. Binary logic and elementary first order propositional calculus are an important aspect of language and seems to have little in common with the perception of objects in space. Nevertheless, we show that classical logic can be derived from the primeval concept of orientation that has emerged in human cognition during Paleolithic worship activity. From there, all higher thought structures can be developed. Thought is a neuronal filter for the perception of that which is. Understanding this deep layer of thought is vital to develop highly competitive, reliable and effective cognitive robot and brain-inspired system.},

In this work the preliminary results of the implementation of the Diploma in Programming and Educational Robotics are shown. The interest that this training arouses is highlighted by the participation of teachers from locations far from the headquarters of the dictating academic unit, from different areas of knowledge and with a motivation in line with the objectives of this educational proposal. Likewise, it is also verified that teachers have incorporated the knowledge and techniques of programming and have consolidated competencies for digital culture, such as collaboration, communication and creativity, necessary to achieve a more effective and motivating learning in students.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder that causes memory and thinking skill loss. Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.},

  abstract={In an increasingly technological world, it is becoming more important to be able to fix equipment as it breaks down. In many places, it seems like companies do not focus on such abilities, whether it is through the design of the product, some form of warranty, or Digital Rights Management companies trying to get in the way of repairs. This trend may have been going on for longer than we think, with many companies seemingly changing focus at some point. Nevertheless, what are the benefits of device and product repair? Why not just throw out the broken product and buy a new one? In this paper, we will give a history of the right to repair and discuss how long the anti-repair engineering trend has gone on. We will also go into the potential costs and benefits of engineering with the right to repair in mind and the expenses that come with the current way companies operate. In the end, this paper should inform how, as a whole, the greater world could benefit from right to repair legislation and design. We also intend to cover the potential benefits of the right to repair for businesses that normally impede the right, in addition to the tangible benefits of applying Six Sigma to right to repair.},

  abstract={Enhancing student academic performance and transdisciplinary ability is challenging, but the time and effort put into accomplishing this ambitious feat is priceless. We develop secure privacy preserving across Personal Health Data (PHD) repository and single-cell genomics research for building an Innovative Systematic Pedagogy for Integrated Research - Education (INSPIRE) (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/csce17_awards). In this paper we further build a novel, eclectic, and insightful framework based on classical and popular machine learning approaches to help us meet the educational challenge. Our framework focuses on using integrative research technologies to help solve “Education’s Performance Prediction Data Mining Crisis” (EPPDMC), by putting to rest issues associated with mining and making best use of big data for educational enhancement, such as multi-source education acquisition, data fusion, and unstructured data analysis. We exploit the uses of deep learning, text classification, and semi-supervised learning approaches to solve challenging problems that educators face when analyzing multiplatform big data involved in education, research and training students. Based on new machine learning approached we developed for genomic big-data research and in combination with machine learning methods (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/keynotes_lectures/yang_talk) and the vast availability of education data available to us, not only can we utilize structured, unstructured, and even multi-media data, but while engaging in leaning intelligent thinking along the way, we can also maximize the utilization of big data by studying the motion and performance of these data. Hence we build the INSPIRE model that can further incorporate Student Face Expression in Class (SFEiC) to help educators and managers make further improvements as they become involved in the teaching-learning process. This research further facilitates the effectiveness of the INSPIRE model.},

  pages={1161-1173},
  abstract={With advances in circuit design and sensing technology, the acquisition of data from a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors simultaneously to enable more accurate inferences has become mainstream. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the fusion of multimodal and multiresolution data obtained from several sensors. The proposed model enables the fusion of multiresolution sensor data, without having to resort to padding/ resampling to correct for frequency resolution differences even when carrying out temporal inferences like high-resolution event detection. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for sleep apnea event detection, by fusing three different sensor signals obtained from UCD St. Vincent University Hospital&#x2019;s sleep apnea database. The proposed model is generalizable and this is demonstrated by incremental performance improvements, proportional to the number of sensors used for fusion. A selective dropout technique is used to prevent overfitting of the model to any specific high-resolution input, and increase the robustness of fusion to signal corruption from any sensor source. A fusion model with electrocardiogram (ECG), Peripheral oxygen saturation signal (SpO2), and abdominal movement signal achieved an accuracy of 99.72&#x0025; and a sensitivity of 98.98&#x0025;. Energy per classification of the proposed fusion model was estimated to be approximately 5.61 <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>J for on-chip implementation. The feasibility of pruning to reduce the complexity of the fusion models was also studied.},

  abstract={The authors present the results of an architectural comparison of SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) massive parallelism, as implemented in the Thinking Machines Corp. CM-2, and vector or concurrent-vector processing, as implemented in the Cray Research Inc., Y-MP/8. The comparison is based primarily upon three application codes taken from the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) CM-2 workload. Tests were run by porting CM Fortran codes to the Y-MP, so that nearly the same level of optimization was obtained on both machines. The results for fully configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64 k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes. The authors show the similarity of the CM-2 and Y-MP programming models and comment on selected future massively parallel processor designs.<>},

  abstract={Privacy requires more than just encryption of data before and during transmission. Privacy would actually demand hiding the sheer fact that communication takes place. This requires to protect meta-data from observation. We think that this feature is in particular useful and interesting for the Internet-of-Things. However, it requires strong cryptographic security mechanisms, like encryption of communication, to be in place. We motivate the need for strong privacy protection by highlighting privacy issues in a smart home use-case. We advance beyond encryption and discuss which existing techniques can be used to achieve unobservable communication. Then we describe the architecture needed to provide strong protection in this particular use-case. Lastly, we present the building blocks of the architecture we implemented so far on the Re-Mote sensor nodes running Contiki OS and sketch the computational and network overheads imposed by these techniques.},

  abstract={This paper is about a particular technical problem in the study of autonomy in constructed complex systems: how can a computing system decide that it needs a new symbol system to re-express all of its own processes? We have shown earlier that a constructed complex system will need to change its symbol system, by proving two theorems that limit what it can do with a fixed symbol system. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. In this paper, we show how a constructed complex system can decide that it needs to change its symbol system, and how it can do it. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas.},

  abstract={Grid computing enables sharing, selection, and aggregation of a wide variety of geographically distributed computational resources such as supercomputers, clusters, storage systems and data sources. A grid presents them as one unified resource for solving large-scale and data intensive computing applications. A middleware supports applications in distributed computing environments by providing services that enable the interconnectivity and interoperability of applications, systems and machines. Considering the great development of grid systems, aggregation of several national and international grids offer more resources,improve and optimize the results. However, given the diversity of architectures and middlewares, it is important to think about solutions for interoperability between systems. In this paper, we present an architecture for enabling interoperability between the Tunisian national grid GTRS, based on the Peer-to-Peer middleware XtremWeb-CH, and the grid infrastructure of EU funded project EUMEDGRID based on gLite.In particular, we describe the solution related with the job submission mechanism that allows for users of EUMEDGRID to send jobs to GTRS.A new concept of Super Worker Node is proposed in this work to reach the interoperability between the two grids of GTRS and EUMEDGRID.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence},

  abstract={LncRNAs have been discovered to play important roles in biology processes and progression of some severe genetic diseases, such as cancer. However, a number of lncRNAs is lack of function annotations. To understand the functions of lncRNAs is a key step for biology and medical research. Computational method is more suitable for large-scale experiment than biological experimental method due to time and expense, and it can provide reference and basis for biological experiment. Nonetheless, developing computational method to predict function of a newly detected lncRNA is still a challenging task. Some lncRNAs work according to binding with proteins, so calculating interaction preferences of lncRNA-protein may provide novel breakthrough to develop new computational approaches. In this work, we propose a novel lncRNA function prediction method to link function of lncRNAs and RNA binding protein. The method consists of two steps: firstly, we improve the CNN models of DLPRB, a high-performance deep neural network for protein-RNA binding preferences prediction, secondly, we apply a voting algorithm to predict lncRNA function by integrating binding preference predicting models. As we know, it is the first time that using RNA-protein preferences to predict function of lncRNAs. We test the predicting approach with 25 lncRNAs from LncBook, and the results confirm our approach makes sense. The approach only uses sequence-based features, so it can be a novel choice for newly detected lncRNA function prediction. We think this work can provide new insights for lncRNA research.},

  abstract={Dramatic developments in localization techniques have been achieved recently to overcome the difficulties of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The diversity of IoT in nearly all sectors, which requires the connection among objects, makes localization an important aspect in the field as it adds to the features of IoT. Precisely estimating the position of an object is one of the main purposes of localization to facilitate the exchange of information among the objects. The aim of this work is to explore the existing localization techniques and to evaluate existing encapsulating classification systems. For the literature survey, we have searched in all major databases. Relevant papers (amongst more than hundreds of the papers) are considered and evaluated to contribute to this work. In conclusion, the presented survey will assist people who are working in the field of localization in IoT and different related methods.},

  abstract={Classification is the key and most widely studied paradigm in machine learning community. The selection of appropriate classification algorithm for a particular problem is a challenging task, formally known as algorithm selection problem (ASP) in literature. It is increasingly becoming focus of research in machine learning community. Meta-learning has demonstrated substantial success in solving ASP, especially in the domain of classification. Considerable progress has been made in classification algorithm recommendation and researchers have proposed various methods in literature that tackles ASP in many different ways in meta-learning setup. Yet there is a lack of survey and comparative study that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. To fill these gaps, in this paper we first present a literature survey of classification algorithm recommendation methods. The survey shed light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifier selection through meta-learning and comprehensively discusses the different phases of classifier selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we critically analyzed and summarized the existing studies from the literature in three important dimensions i.e., meta-features, meta-learner and meta-target. In the second part of this paper, we present extensive comparative evaluation of all the prominent methods for classifier selection based on 17 classification algorithms and 84 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of classifier selection methods and highlight the limitations and strengths of meta-features, meta-learners and meta-target in classification algorithm recommendation system. Finally, we conclude this paper by identifying current challenges and suggesting future work directions. We expect that this work will provide baseline and a solid overview of state of the art works in this domain to new researchers, and will steer future research in this direction.},
