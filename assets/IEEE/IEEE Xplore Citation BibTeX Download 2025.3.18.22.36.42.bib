  abstract={Advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. Today’s "digital natives" have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital ("plugged") and non-digital ("unplugged") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented.},

  title={How do Bebras Tasks Explore Algorithmic Thinking Skill in a Computational Thinking Contest?}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.},

  title={Design Thinking and computational modeling to stop illegal poaching}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={175-181},
  abstract={In this paper, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using STEM to solving a real-world problem involving poaching. This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries. The program has helped to promote the much needed awareness of using STEM based solutions to solve global challenges through a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach involving students and faculty from mathematical sciences and engineering who continue to collaborate.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is defined as the thought process of formulating problems and expressing their solutions. In recent times, children increasingly program and CT is a fundamental skill to master. Research shows children often lack such skill. In this work, we contribute an analysis of the ROOT robot system and its associated curriculum to aid in the development of CT skills in children aged 4–10 years old (in China). In particular, we measure the concepts of abstraction, analysis, generalization, algorithmic thinking, logical thinking, sequential problem solving, self-confidence, and self-checking capability throughout a 10-week course. The results show 71% students developed “Excellent” CT performance and 29% achieved “Good” performance. The key lesson is that children's CT skills develop positively when programming with the ROOT learning platform.},

  abstract={While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.},

  abstract={The computational processing methods appeared to overcome the drawbacks of the symbolic processing method. Recently the serious limitations of the computational processing methods have been found through the development of the highly intelligent user interface systems. The simple solutions to the limitations are the return to the symbolism or the use of the hierarchical system architecture. However it is indispensable deeply to combine the symbolic and computational processing in order to realize the highly intelligent system. The leading attempts toward the combination of computational and symbolic processing are overviewed. The level of the combination is not deep, high and wide enough. Our approach based on the emergent recurrent neural network and the language processing toward the deep fusion of symbolic and computational processing is proposed. In this new architecture, the symbolic processing and the computational processing should affect each other at anytime, at anywhere and at any abstract level.},

Firstly, the definition, classification and function of design sketch are explained. Secondly, its importance in the product design process is analyzed. Then design sketch is compared with computer rendering. The uncertainty of design sketch is presented to reveal its ambiguity. Thirdly, the relationship between the ambiguity of design sketch and creative thinking is discussed. Finally, the teaching points of design sketch are proposed from two aspects of presentation techniques and training contents. Appropriate drawing tools and techniques should be chosen according to the characteristics of different stages of the design process and progressive training should be insisted on, so that design sketch can really serve as a primer for the successive courses of product design.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The CDIO Framework within engineering education is based on the idea that graduates should be capable of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating (i.e., CDIO) complex systems within a team-based learning environment. As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.},

To train the brain to think in logical terms it is necessary to use adequate resources. In this paper we address the difficult problem that is assessing efficacy of a given resource to the Computation Thinking development. To discuss that topic we will use the Melodic System which is a physical learning resource capable of constructing melodic sequences in a logical manner to be used by visually impaired people. Melodic was created aiming at training Computational Thinking through music and sounds and its impact in the learning process must be evaluated. This paper presents the tests and results applied to this intent, while also providing a general and summarized presentation of the Melodic System itself.},

A high percentage of the research nowadays focuses on how to impart knowledge of computer in the perspective of computational thinking. But more importantly, the research ignores an important way to train thinking - practice. This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course. Finally, we introduce a set of virtual experiment libraries, which are independent research and development.

The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is one barrier to enculturating as a professional engineer. We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering.},

  abstract={Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

Computational thinking (CT) is a term invented by “J.M. Wing, 2006” to describe a set of thinking skills, behaviors, and approaches that are integral to solving complex challenges using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.},

  abstract={Cognitive testing is concerned with quantitative and qualitative evaluation of an individual's intellectual functioning in its broad sense. Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract={The modern board game market (MBG) has been evolving gradually, and its mechanics appear to support concepts of Computational Thinking (CT). Seen as pedagogical resources applicable in the classroom context, this study analysed 10 MBGs with the aim of identifying aspects that can promote the development of CT, with a special focus on the modern board game 'Rossio.' Building upon the LM-TM model, an adapted version of the LM-GM model for board games, we propose a new framework that relates Computational Thinking learning mechanics (CTLM-TM) with tabletop game mechanisms.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.},
