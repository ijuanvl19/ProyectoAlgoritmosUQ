  abstract={In a previous paper we showed and discussed how computational information conservation theory (CICT) can help us to develop even competitive advanced quantum cognitive computational systems. To achieve reliable system intelligence outstanding results, current computational system modeling and simulation community has to face and to solve two orders of modeling limitations at least. As a solution, we propose an exponential, prespatial arithmetic scheme (“all-powerful scheme”) by CICT to overcome the Information Double-Bind (IDB) problem and to thrive on both deterministic noise (DN) and random noise (RN) to develop powerful cognitive computational frameworks for deep learning, towards deep thinking applications. An operative example is presented. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to develop deeper learning and deep thinking system and application at your fingertips and beyond.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of global supply chain, the existing methodology and solution struggle to cope with the operation of complex logistics systems (CLS). Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.},

  abstract={Given the pervasive reliance on technology in modern society, teaching Computational Thinking (CT) abilities is becoming increasingly relevant. These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.},

  abstract={The broad-scale emergence of AI in industry calls forth basic questions in terms of the knowledge bases and approaches relevant for its design. Engineering design has been mainly developed for electromechanical artifacts. In practice, this has meant that the scientific knowledge required for creating technical artifacts such as engines, cars, ships, cranes, telephones, radios, TVs, and simple data processing units has been natural science. However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI. To grasp intelligent information processing, we need concepts and approaches suited for the task. To create intelligent technologies on this basis, we need concepts and approaches that afford the operationalization of such information in artificial systems. We suggest that psychology of thinking and cognitive modeling provide a logical basis for future AI design.},

  abstract={The concept of systems thinking (and its embodiment in systems approach and systems science) dates from the historical origins of engineering, policy, and philosophy. However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.},

The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the “programming to learn” approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of “learning to program” in isolation.},

  abstract={Security for every organization in the digital space is of primary focus and to better highlight and define the strategies to keep the systems safe and secure is of prime importance. While unauthorized access and unethical actions by intruders remain a cause of concern, ensuring the right measures through proper Threat Modelling techniques is necessary to create a barrier against them. The intention of getting access to a system or website or server can be born out of multiple threat groups and can be classified into common security threats. This paper looks at a persona-based approach to identify user groups that can be a threat to a system and how we can use the concepts of Design Thinking to model the system and protect it from possible security breaches. Considering the agile methodologies of software development, the paper talks about focusing on a perspective that discusses a design methodology by keeping the individuals and interactions for working models at the top of threat modelling measures.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process designed to help students better solve complex problems using mental tools such as decomposition, abstraction, heuristics, data collection, algorithms, modeling, and communication (Wing, 2006). This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms.},

  abstract={Currently, there is a daily evolution of the world and our current digital society faces challenges for changing the environment. Currently, learning environments are undergoing an evolution due the increasing development of mobile technologies. Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT. We aim to deliver open assessment adapted to specific learner context profile, progress and CT’s Level in the learning.},

  abstract={In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.},

  abstract={Recent years have seen a high volume of computational thinking (CT) review studies. However, there have been no existing studies that map these reviews with the goal of achieving comprehensive understanding of the field of CT. This paper utilizes Tikva & Tambouris’ (2021) K-12 CT research domain conceptual model as the basis for identifying and defining CT reviews, then maps the identified 38 CT reviews onto the identified domains. We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including "communities" of tools, "modeling simulations," "problem-solving" and "scaffolding" of learning strategies, "demographic attributes" of factors, "practices" and "perspectives" of the knowledge-based areas, and the "teacher training" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term "unplugged" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews. Our results help to better understand the CT review field and formulate future directions.},

  abstract={In the realm of computational physics education, enhancing student engagement remains a pivotal challenge. This research delved into the potential of Project-Based Learning (PBL), with a particular emphasis on the VBA Physics Simulation, to invigorate students’ learning engagement. By surveying undergraduate students’ perceptions in computational physics course, we observed a predominant positive response towards the PBL model. The findings underscore that students not only appreciate the structured learning experience PBL offers but also value the guidance from lecturers in this approach. Through the lens of PBL, students reported a marked improvement in various skills, including the 4C skills (Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity), problem-solving, and higher-order thinking skills. This study advocates for the broader integration of PBL in computational physics course, especially using tools like VBA Physics Simulation, as a means to deepen understanding and amplify student engagement. We also recommend future quantitative research to further solidify these findings.},

These shortages in case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GA) were analyzed by the model. It was proved that the fundamental reason of these shortages is that they only can simulate a single process in the model of creative thinking. Then a simulation algorithm of directed similarity association is brought forward so as to realize the computation of similarity degree of product demand between components, and simulate the whole model of creative thinking by combining CBR and GA. A corresponding product design system was put forward, and then an experiment was conducted, and the results show that the combined intelligent algorithm has good performance in search.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a fundamental analytical ability to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior based on the fundamental concepts of computer science. The concept of computational thinking is almost needed on every profession in the computerization of society. Teaching computational thinking to cultivate problem solving ability by computer is a challenge of computer science education, especially for the K-12 level. Although studies introduce computational concepts by programming design, computational thinking and computer science are not computer programming. The study uses social simulation content (i.e. NetLogo, which uses muti-agent technology) to scaffold learning computational thinking concepts, such as simple genetic algorithm, parallel computing, artificial neural net, or deadlock (such as dining philosophers). To stimulate learning transfer onto computational thinking, NetLogo models library will be used to motivate reflection and meta-cognition development. Preliminary experimental results came from both questionnaires and artifacts. In the future, Gero's (1990) function-behaviour-structure (FBS) ontology will be used for the qualitative analysis to explain the outcomes of learning transfer.},

  abstract={Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.},

  abstract={Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.},

  abstract={At present, innovation courses for college students play a vital role in universities. It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a set of thinking processes used by computer scientists to formulate problems and describe solutions. In recent years, CT has been largely explored by the Computing Education community. Due to its potential to contribute to problem solving and analytical thinking, CT could also be a relevant subject in K-12 education. For such, there is a need to qualify educators in CT. In this paper, we describe our experience in a large-scale course on Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers. Our goal is to qualify pre-service teachers in CT, both in the comprehension of its definition and how it can be incorporated in classroom. Our experience indicates that the participants had a positive awareness of CT concepts, as well as an adequate understanding of the pedagogical approaches to teach the subject. They also developed positive attitudes towards the field of Computer Science.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. This course will look at the synergies that are required across the stack from new devices to new computational models for designing future computing systems. This course will enable attendees to understand the inter-twined nature of design optimization that requires one to interact with experts in different domains. The students will be exposed to simulation tools and modelling techniques to help explore new circuits and architectures. As physical dimensional scaling alone has ceased to be the key factor driving the industry, many innovations have occurred in designing new types of logic switches including changes to their structure (such as three-dimensional FinFETs), their underlying physics (use of tunneling for steep-switching devices), the material systems (integration of ferro-electrics in gate stack for Negative Capacitance FETs). The first part of the lecture will introduce these devices, simulation models and accompanying circuit innovations. There has been a world of revolution in the memory devices with the emergence of many nonvolatile memory technologies and their tight integration in cross-point architectures. These memory systems have enabled new styles of computing systems such as the non-volatile processor for internet of thing systems and neuromorphic computing systems for cognitive computing. The lectures will focus on the synergistic coordination in advances in devices to system design. Neuromorphic systems also leverage new advances in technology such as cross-point memory arrays to integrate computing and store. Another emerging novel computational model is based on the principle “let physics do the computation”. This technique focuses on using the intrinsic operation mechanism of devices (such as nanoscale electronic coupled oscillators) to do the computation, instead of building complex circuits with standard transistors to carry out the same function. The primary objective is to train the next generation researchers and practitioners that can understand the synergy across the stack from devices to applications. This will prepare the next generation workforce for the beyond Moore era using post-CMOS devices and new computational paradigms beyond Von-Neumann computing models. This course will introduce the following topics: [1] Emerging logic and memory devices: What value do they add for circuit designers/architects? [2] Circuit/Architecture design using Emerging Logic and Memory devices [3] Neuromorphic and Brain-Inspired Computing using emerging devices [4] Computing Using Coupled Dynamical Systems.},

  abstract={This research full paper presents the design of an automatic classifier for Computational Thinking skills in math questions, based on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. We trained and evaluated our model using a dataset of real-world math questions. We obtained encouraging results that indicate the proposed approach may ease the process of assessing the level of alignment between math questions and Computational Thinking skills, which may help improve the problem-solving ability in students of elementary school. These results stimulate the use of automated environments for the elaboration, classification, and resolution of math questions in conformity with Computational Thinking skills.},

  abstract={Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.},

The CSER MOOC builds upon recent advances in the development of the Australian Curriculum Digital Technologies learning area, which explicitly addresses the development of computational thinking skills, moving ICT education away from digital literacy towards embedding the skills needed for the next generation to become creators of technology. The CSER MOOC presents a broad coverage of core computational thinking concepts, with a focus on integrating with existing learning areas and appropriate pedagogy for the K-6 context. In this paper, we discuss our course curriculum, its alignment with key concepts from the formal curriculum statements, example teacher assessments, and discuss key challenges and concerns.},
