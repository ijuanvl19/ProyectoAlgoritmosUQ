  abstract={In this paper, we propose that the data generated by educational robots can be better used by applying learning analytics methods and techniques which can lead to a deeper understanding of the learners' apprehension and behavior as well as refined guidelines for roboticists and improved interventions by the teachers. As a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team and/or individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.},

  abstract={Game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and also have a unique capacity to engage students. Yet they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior gaming experience. This is especially concerning in computer science education, as certain underrepresented groups (such as female students) may on average have less prior experience with games. This paper presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can successfully address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, we first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment, and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at serving all students. In earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach may, over time, compensate for gender differences in experience and lead to equitable learning experiences within game-based learning environments for computer science education.},

  abstract={Visual block programming environments can be defined as those programming environments that rely on objects rather than words to code the program. These types of environments are characterized by facilitating the task of the people who carry out the programs. This is mainly since they are more visually friendly. In addition, with this type of environment the person who makes the programs will not get the famous syntactic errors that characterize the programming tasks with textual programming languages. Along this paper, a set of tools commonly used in educational robotics are showed. Furthermore, a deep analysis in two of these tools are detailed. Additionally, some educational scenarios are detailed, as long as their relationship to students’ competencies and how to drive the scenarios in order to accomplish with the competencies. Finally, a study of the results from experience is included.},

  abstract={Starting from our teaching experience and previous research on programming for non-technical university students in Japan and Denmark, we identify an unarticulated dependency of programming materials from other technical domains, which causes a knowledge domain mismatch in learners. We approach this mismatch on two fronts: by defining a novel way to structure beginners courses that moves away from the classic bottom-up approach based on math-related problems, and instead leverages on multimedia as a motivational and powerful general-purpose domain to ground programming and scaffold its understanding; and via the design and implementation of new Python library that simplifies multimedia programming. We are currently organizing tests of both multimedia library and the new course structure in Japan and Denmark.},

  title={Empirical Evidence of the Usage of Programming Languages in the Educational Process}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={64},
  number={3},
  pages={213-222},
  abstract={Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

  abstract={The work presented in this Full Paper is categorized as Innovative Practice, as per FIE guidelines. Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.},

  pages={1996-2002},
  abstract={The Digital Logic and Computer Architecture related courses are one of the key knowledge areas in Computer Science (CS) used to enhance students' understanding of Boolean algebra, logic gates, registers, arithmetic logic units, etc. and provides insights how software and hardware are related in a computing system. Experimental Centric based Instructional Pedagogy (ECP) with portable laboratory instrumentation might provide real hands-on experience to obtain a practical understanding of the concepts at a lower cost compared to virtual hands-on laboratories. This paper presents the initial adaptation of an evidence-based, experiment-focused teaching approach to introduce the fundamentals of digital logic concepts using the commercial ADALM 1K Active Learning Module in a Computer Architecture course for the first time in the CS department at a university serving predominantly minority students. To evaluate the impact of the ECP on student performance in the Computer Architecture course, we conducted three different evaluations, which are class observation, signature assignment, and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MLSQ) survey. The results of the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) show more student engagement when ECP is implemented; the output of the signature assignment shows an increase in students' learning outcomes; and the MLSQ survey, which tests the students' motivation, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration, and metacognition, ascertains the effect of the ECP on the CS students who participated in the experiment.},

  abstract={Artificial neural network is an intelligent bionic model based on physiology, which simulates the thinking ability of human brain, and finds out regular things by studying, recalling, summarizing and sorting out a large number of cases. Because of the heterogeneity, distribution and dynamics of grid, traditional resource management methods are not suitable for grid environment. In view of the fact that the traditional resource management model can't meet the demand of service grid, this paper studies the resource management model based on the principles of computational economics and the characteristics of service grid environment, and proposes a resource management model based on computational economics. Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to establish a national economic forecasting model. In the process of modeling, immune particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the neural network model, so that the predicted data of the model is closer to the actual data.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},

  pages={137-144},
  abstract={The application of Grid technology is at the transition from engineering and natural science-related industrial sectors to other industries that have a high demand for computing resources. However, the diffusion of Grid technology within industrial sectors which are not naturally engineering and natural science-related is often hindered by a lack of incentives to share the computational resources. A promising way to overcome these barriers is the introduction of economically inspired mechanisms for the use of Grid-based resources. Our work introduces a iterated cost-based multi-unit resource auction (CMRA) and compares a traditional cost-based accounting approach with dedicated servers as well as a pooling approach with regard to service quality and total costs. The cost-calculus used in our model is based on costs for the delayed processing of jobs and costs for the cancellation of these jobs if the job cannot be provided at a certain time span in the worst case. The simulation results indicate that pooling of IT resources by Grid technology can produce a reduction of 20.3% in cost within this model compared to dedicated servers in the computing centers. However, with the CMRA-based allocation of computing resources, a further 1.4% of cost reduction can be achieved while the achieved quality-of-service (QoS) can be significantly increased. Finally we think that there must be a further cost reduction potential for Grid solutions beyond these savings that can be achieved by using economically inspired allocation methods that are combined with advanced refining and learning methods.},

  abstract={In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are in higher demand more than ever before. While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today's problems. It is not just desirable but essential that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis surveys a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as are used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis illustrates the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in analyzing network data, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. It also discusses some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions that arise in network analysis and social influences.},

As we all know, pre-visualization is an important stage in film production, involving subjective choices by the creators. This paper investigates how AI can assist filmmakers during the pre-production stage by generating mood boards from text. We propose a novel preproduction pipeline and guidelines that leverage text-to-image models to create visual previews of film projects. We also conduct a case study to validate and evaluate our approach's effectiveness. Our case study suggests that following the guidelines we have developed can assist filmmakers in generating mood boards that effectively convey the desired atmosphere of their projects and potentially contribute to enhancing the creative process.

  abstract={This innovative practice work in progress paper discusses the integration of Model-Eliciting Activities (MEA) into in software engineering (SE) classes, and the challenges faced in preparing and delivering these activities. The preparation and implementation of MEA in SE classes can be challenging, as it requires creating self-assessable MEA questions that simulate real-world problems, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing learning outcomes. In this research, the authors address these challenges and gain practical experience in designing and implementing MEA in SE classes. The authors conducted experiments over two consecutive semesters in SE courses that cover topics such as requirement solicitation, design and implementation, software testing techniques, secure software, and software quality assurance. They incorporated MEA questions that simulate real-world problems into both face-to-face and online classes, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing the learning gains. This paper contributes to the distribution of MEA application for SE courses. It presents the authors' experiences, challenges, reports evaluations, and findings in implementing MEA in SE courses. Overall, this paper provides insights into the effective integration of MEA into SE courses, and the benefits it can bring to students' learning outcomes.},

  abstract={Generative AI (GAI) technologies like ChatGPT are permanently changing academic education. Their integration opens up vast opportunities for bespoke learning and better student interaction but also brings about academic honesty issues and the application of real-life educators. This study aims to fill the literature gap regarding the use of multiple GAI tools and their effect on academic outcomes via a comprehensive review. A systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize results on the potential and drawbacks of GAI in educational domains. We included theoretical and empirical papers that used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs. We have also explored conceptual frameworks and the most creative AI applications with a special emphasis on uniqueness and practicability. Experiences, and Perceptions Concerning To compile the information needed we gathered insights into what students were going through by conducting the survey which contains 200 respondents of undergraduate university students gathering insights into the college students’ experiences and perceptions related to GAI used for educational purposes. At the basic level, GAI comprises areas like personalization, task automation, teacher assistance, and efficiency among others, and respective solutions for the immersion of a learner in learning processes to reform directions. However, it generates plenty of challenges such as the question of assessment integrity, the risk that too much automated grading could overwhelm educational value, and relevantly the veracity of AI-generated content as well as the potential disruption to skills like critical thinking, in addition to data privacy and ethical issues. Student Perception Survey the text also indicates that most students, as per the student perception survey found AI systems useful in academic support. However, they also know the other side of the coin and are very familiar with the technology constraints and challenges.},

  abstract={The world is experiencing an AI revolution, with large language models (LLMs) transforming various industries, including education. Academics are striving to harness the potential of LLMs while also contending with their risks. This paper presents the first bibliometric analysis focused on LLM research in programming education, identifying leading countries, authors, and institutions while analyzing key terms and popular keywords in this field. Additionally, it highlights influential studies on topics such as introductory programming, computer science, computing, programming education, and prompt engineering, discussing key insights from these works. Findings indicate that LLMs could play a significant role in programming education and may be integrated into computer science curricula. However, careful consideration is needed to ensure their benefits outweigh their risks across various use cases. This study specifically examines ChatGPT as a representative LLM, exploring its benefits and limitations as both a learning aid for students and a support tool for professionals. It also evaluates the quality of ChatGPT-generated code and its effectiveness in simplifying programming concepts for beginners. Furthermore, the ethical implications of increasing reliance on LLMs for programming tasks, including concerns about dependency, plagiarism, and potential effects on critical thinking, are addressed. By contributing to the ongoing discourse on integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in programming education, this research emphasizes the importance of responsible and ethical usage to maximize benefits for students, educators, and the broader educational community.},

For these systems, the construction of a model that accurately predicts the details of system behavior is essentially impossible, and any model for these systems is certain to be "wrong" in at least some details. If modeling and simulation is to be used to reason from what is known about such systems, we must understand how to think usefully with "wrong" models. This paper describes an approach based on exploratory modeling and adaptive strategies that can be used to make decisions about systems that are so complex their detailed behavior cannot be predicted. This approach seeks to find strategies that perform reasonably well over broad ranges of plausible futures-instead of devising strategies that are optimal for some particular best estimate model.},

  abstract={As computing technologies develop, there is a trend in traffic simulation research in which the focus is moving from macro- and meso-simulation to micro-simulation since micro-simulation can provide more detailed quantitative results. Moreover, the success of the Artificial societies-Computational experiments-Parallel execution (ACP) approach indicates that integrating other metropolitan systems such as logistic, infrastructure, legal and regulatory, and weather and environmental systems to build an Artificial Transportation System (ATS) can be helpful in solving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) problems. However, the computational burden is very heavy as there are many agents interacting in parallel in the ATS. Therefore, a parallel computing tool is desirable. We think that we can employ a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which has been applied in many areas. In this paper, we use a GPU-adapted Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to solve the problem of generating daily activity plans for individual and household agents in the ATS, which is important as the activity plans determine the traffic demand in the ATS. Previous research has shown that GA is effective but that the computational burden is heavy. We extend the work to GPU and test our method on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU for two scenarios of generating plans for 1000 individual agents and 1000 three-person household agents. Speedup factors of 23 and 32 are obtained compared with implementations on a mainstream CPU.},

  abstract={A pattern classifier named Hash-based Associative Memory-like Pattern Classifier (HAPC) based on hashing technique, associative memory, and human deep-thinking logic is proposed in this paper to solve pattern classification problems without complicated mathematical computation. In the hashing layer of the designed system, one of the similarity-preserve hashing is used to convert the input samples to hashed data which dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the data but keeps the similarity information. In the clustering layer, hashed samples are divided into different clusters, which can be considered a feature extraction process based on the similarity of the hash value. In the associate memory layer, each cluster will be trained as an associate memory to store the hashed data stably. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is used to perform the decision-making process to classify the testing sample without complicated mathematical computation. In the simulation, we are able to achieve a good result, especially on small numbers of training data.},

  abstract={The ability to think has been one of the most fascinating features of robots in science fiction since the introduction of the word 'robot' by Karel Capek in his Czech science fiction play, known as 'Rossum's Universal Robots' in English [1]. Since Capek's first depiction in 1921, science fictionists generally portray robots as intelligent humanoid machines that are subservient to humans. Android is another term used for such robots in modern linguistics. However, the development of robots with the ability to think has largely been a fantasy for robot scientists and engineers. Nevertheless, the evolution of robots has come a long way since the first industrial robot 'Unimate' in 1954. Robots have transformed from large automated manufacturing facilities to applications in our homes and even into our pockets as software robots in our PDAs and smart phones [2], [3]. This paper classifies robot intelligence into six categories: cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioral intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. This classification categorizes the intelligence of robots based on the different aspects of awareness and the ability to act deliberately as a result of such awareness.},

  abstract={Reasoning, a trait of cognitive intelligence, is regarded as a crucial ability that distinguishes humans from other species. However, neural networks now pose a challenge to this human ability. Text-to-image synthesis is a class of vision and linguistics, wherein the goal is to learn multimodal representations between the image and text features. Hence, it requires a high-level reasoning ability that understands the relationships between objects in the given text and generates high-quality images based on the understanding. Text-to-image translation can be termed as the visual thinking of neural networks. In this study, our model infers the complicated relationships between objects in the given text and generates the final image by leveraging the previous history. We define diverse novel adversarial loss functions and finally demonstrate the best one that elevates the reasoning ability of the text-to-image synthesis. Remarkably, most of our models possess their own reasoning ability. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with several methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR) is an utilitarian tool to capture diverse information from decision makers under uncertain situations. How to improve the unacceptable consistency level for HFLPR is a key issue to guarantee the reliability of the decision information. This paper introduces the worst consistency index for HFLPRs to judge the logic of DMs in the worst case. Under the purpose of minimizing the amount of modification, an optimization model is constructed to achieve an acceptable worst consistency level for a HFLPR. A linear programming model is established to reduce the difficulty of solving the presented optimization model. It ensures the consistency indices related to all the possible linguistic preference relations (LPRs) from a given HFLPR meet the predefined consistency level requirement. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a numerical example to show it's significance.},

  abstract={The surge of interest in artificial intelligence systems has sparked new directions of research in the realm of music data analysis. At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions. We claim that the presented approach not only opens avenues for penetrating and nuanced analysis, but also enriches our comprehension of the intricate interplay of musical components and their manifestations inspired by neural networks.},

  abstract={Due to the limited data transmission capability, most of the sensor nodes in the wireless sensor networks(WSN) cannot send data to the base station directly. In most situations the data transfer has to be done by the means of multi-hop. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH) is one of the most widely used multi-hop strategies. However, as there are many random factors interrelated with each other in the networks, it's very difficult to evaluate the network performance for LEACH, which has become a hotpot of current research. Since lifetime is the most important network performance indicator, this paper collects the network operation parameters including working period through multi-agent simulation and computational experiments, and evaluates the network performance in different situations based on the collected data. The results would provide practical advices for optimizing the network performance and come up with a new thinking of adopting multi-agent simulation in WSN research.},
