  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper deals with the difficulty that it is possible to teach computational thinking through the teaching of algorithms and programming to a person with ADD. We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered an important skill set for 21st-century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. In this paper, we investigated what is the Greek Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ understanding and awareness as far as Computational Thinking is concerned. Since teachers are the agents of change, it is critical to find out how familiar and/or skilled they are with the Computational Thinking notion. Thus, we applied a qualitative questionnaire all over the whole Greek State where 406 teachers answered. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the teacher’s readiness, as well as more generic aspects according to their profile and faculty.},

  pages={193-205},
  abstract={With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, a myriad of guides are being published to support educators who are teaching this subject, often for the first time. Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.},

  abstract={The Computational Thinking (CT) conceptual framework is entering its second decade of research yet still lacks a cohesive definition by which the field can coalesce. The lack of clear definition makes assessment tool challenging to formulate, pedagogical efforts difficult to compare, and research difficult to synthesize. This paper looks to operationalize differing definitions of CT enhancing the ability to teach then assess the presence of CT. Expanding upon CT definitions, industry practices and processes, and educational theory, we link existing concepts and propose a new element to model an active definition of CT as a theoretical framework to guide future research. Our model updates existing CT definition by formally including Modeling, introducing Socio-Technical processes, separating Information Gathering from Data Collection and adding emphasis to Testing as a vital CT concept. We feel these elements and interconnections make CT is easier to describe and measure.},

  abstract={The educational challenges of society permeated by digital technologies are aimed at developing skills to identify and solve environment problems. In this context, computational thinking (CT) emerges as a set of skills to be developed from an early age, which requires the empowerment of programming and demands the use of technological tools. The purpose of this article is to present the design and implementation process of a computer tool for CT evaluation, as well as its validation with a sample of elementary school students from a public institution in Colombia. The methodology focuses on the phases of the SCRUM development process. The results show that women perceive less difficulty in understanding the activities to be solved. It is possible to obtain a web application type software taking into account the evaluated characteristics of the tools used for CT teaching, covering most of these, and with special emphasis on some such as the content in Spanish, instructional model, management of the course, learning activities, monitoring, feedback and gamification.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={2},
  pages={282-291},
  abstract={Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).},

One hundred and forty-nine vocational high schools students participated in this study to see if they can develop adequate thinking style when they learned in a simulation environment with help from agents. The results show that the judicial thinking style was best suited to the system we designed for this project - that is, we observed the greatest amount of development for this particular thinking style.

  abstract={This paper investigates the long-established ecological cognition framework and updates it to better account for the advances in computational science computational intelligence. To do this, two concepts are explored. The first, ‘serendipity engineering for seductive hypermedia,’ looks at how to design information systems to account for the pleasant occurrences that happen in offline environments studied by those in sales and marketing where beneficial outcomes often occur by chance encounters. The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system. The parametric model presented has great applicability for information and communications technology solution providers.},

  title={Formal Concept Analysis of Students’ Solutions on Computational Thinking Game}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={68},
  number={1},
  pages={20-32},
  abstract={Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.},

Abstraction and automation are the core of computational thinking. Therefore, CT is the key skill in Industry 4.0. However, in Malaysia's manufacturing, only 50 percent of SMEs deploy automation. Automation can make the company more efficient, more accurate and decrease human error. CT was built based on 4 basic pillars which are abstraction, decomposition, algorithm and pattern recognition. These pillars will encourage automation, efficiency, and innovation. Moreover, one of the benefits of CT for nonprogrammer is the formulated problem can be passed on to information-processing agents such as third-party companies or freelancers who can create the solution.

  abstract={Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.},

  abstract={The optimal paradigm and systematic solution to scheduling and decision-making for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high nolinear and complexity and the strong coupling and randomness. In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.},

  abstract={The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical & Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.},

  abstract={In computer science and information technology, ontology has been researched and developed in application for knowledge representation. Ontology COKB-ONT (Computational Object Knowledge Base) is an ontology was researched and applied in designing knowledge base systems, such as domain of knowledge about analytic geometry, linear algebra. However, when dealing with a practical problem, we often do not immediately find a new solution, but we search related problems which have been solved before and then proposing an appropriate solution for the problem. In this paper, the extension model of ontology COKB-ONT has been presented. In this model, Sample Problems, which are related problems, will be used like the experience of human about practical problem, simulate the way of human thinking about finding solution of problem. This extension model is applied to construct a program for solving plane geometry problems in middle school.},
