  abstract={Cognitive Computing is a developing paradigm with its applications found in almost every field. It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.},

  title={Synthesis of Liveness-Enforcing Petri Net Supervisors Based on a Think-Globally-Act-Locally Approach and Vector Covering for Flexible Manufacturing Systems}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={5},
  number={},
  pages={16349-16358},
  abstract={This paper proposes the synthesis of Petri net supervisors based on a think-globally-actlocally (TGAL) approach and a vector covering technique for flexible manufacturing systems. Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.},

A between-subject sneaker-design experiment comparing our integrated AI-CST and non-integrated AI-CST shows that our AI-CST can significantly improve designers’ performance.

  abstract={The use of microorganisms for the production of industrially important compounds and enzymes is becoming increasingly important. Eukaryotes have been less widely used than prokaryotes in biotechnology, because of the complexity of their genomic structure and biology. The Yeast2.0 project is an international effort to engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to make it easy to manipulate, and to generate random variants using a system called SCRaMbLE. SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published. Our simulator can be applied to the analysis of the fitness landscapes of any organism for which SCRaMbLE has been implemented.},

  abstract={The paper outlines some direct solution strategies for sparse matrices arising from the finite element (FE) discretization of electromagnetic (EM) models, and explores whether the conventional thinking followed by highly optimized direct method tools for sparse matrices is indeed the best available option for directly solving FEM problems in EM. Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.},

The report recognizes the need for a centralized forum to address these limits by allowing innovators to propose their ideas to domain experts and peers. An online platform where students may submit projects, have them reviewed by mentors, and examine other students’ projects. An assessment of existing systems identified a variety of restrictions for students. Such a platform aims to inspire creative thinking and the execution of unique ideas, hence helping students by boosting cooperation, networking, and project-based learning. This platform serves as a dynamic social hub, allowing students to communicate, present work, and exchange ideas in a lively digital setting. The major project is at the center of a student’s academic journey, a necessary component of their graduation process that challenges them to apply their gathered knowledge to create something unique. Students are currently unaware of their peers accomplishment due to a lack of engagement. This website seeks to address this issue by allowing students to discover their skills and find inspiration for their projects. The platform is intended to streamline the tasks of project mentors and teams. Furthermore, developing a dedicated web portal for our college community enhances access to completed projects, making it a great resource for students of all levels. Centralizing project information aims to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration, ultimately improving the learning experience and developing a culture of student-driven innovation.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel framework that melds the profound tenets of Indian philosophy with AI and ML. Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.},

  abstract={Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Computational creativity is defined as the ability of artificial systems to generate artifacts with substantial novelty and originality, comparable to those crafted by human experts. This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.},

  abstract={Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore.},

  abstract={Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, "a society of mind". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.},

  abstract={We are investigating how non-programmers make sense and solve simple computational problems. We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept.},

  abstract={The human mind crucially thinks and reasons, all the while being conscious. Possible architectures to achieve the first two of these attributes are proposed, the first of these being based on those for the mental simulation loop suggested as being at the basis of thinking. Simulations of the architectures, drawn from infant development and reasoning at a non-linguistic level, justify their ability to achieve their aims. How these activities may become conscious briefly presented as part of the attention control systems (motor and sensory) involved in the overall architecture.},
