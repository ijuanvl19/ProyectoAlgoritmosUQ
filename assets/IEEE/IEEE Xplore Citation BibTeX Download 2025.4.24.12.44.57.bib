  abstract={Is it possible to use stereo images to generate point clouds and to compute rigorous uncertainty maps? Currently, neither modern commercial photogrammetric software nor state-of-the-art algorithms are able to provide a spatial distribution of uncertainty. In this letter, we explain why this is the case, despite a high demand from the user community. Many applications would indeed benefit from the availability of error bars on each point, as uncertainties on derived models and quantities could be accurately predicted. For instance, change detection could be performed rigorously since the statistical significance of observed changes could be computed. In this letter, we focus on dense stereo methods. We first explain that it is not possible to derive reliable predictive uncertainties mainly due to matching and modeling errors. Our research shows that both intrinsic and practical limitations of the algorithms lead to unpredictable artifacts. Then, we focus on the use of empirical errors, showing that, despite the redundancy brought by multiview stereo, there is a fundamental limitation due to the unknown density of independent measurements. We think that these problems will represent a big challenge for the future, as these limitations cannot be addressed by algorithmic design, computational power, or imaging sensor technology.},

  abstract={The article presents a method for implementation of "anytime" algorithms into digital real-time control system for a small turbojet engine iSTC-21v. This method presents an approach that will be used for future work in design of the control system. The presented method is an extension of the actual developed control system of engine, which uses the theory of situational control of complex systems. This control system uses progressive control algorithms. For practical implementation of this control system it is important to think about computational complexity. Control systems of aircraft engines use computer (Full Authority Electronic engine control — FADEC) with limited computation resources. Aircraft engines work in environment with stochastic conditions. It is necessary to ensure reliable and stable operation of engine. Anytime algorithms can help to solve this problem and to meet the safety requirements.},

  title={The icon as a problem in cognition and social construction: complexity and consensual domains in technical rhetoric},

  pages={216-227},
  abstract={Suggests that current theories about how even the simplest elements of graphical design function in professional communication do not adequately convey the complexity of the element's actual role in communication. By showing how producers of computer interfaces rely on the possibility of multiple interpretive trajectories in the use of any sign and how users of such signs respond in ways that are far from being totally predictable, we argue that it is best to think of the communication act not as a simple exchange of information between two minds (producer and user) but rather as a field of possibilities that requires flexibility and an experimental attitude from both the producer and the user. Examining theoretical developments in the history of physics and cognitive science, we contend that the dominant paradigms of understanding communication-the old cognitive (or computational) model and the social constructionist model as currently employed in the fields of composition and technical communication-fall short of accounting for even fairly straightforward exchanges of information. In place of the communication triangle that both of the old models rely upon, we offer a new model that uses the concept of "consensual domains" as the basis for a general theory of rhetoric. As a starting point for our investigation, we present the history of a still evolving sign-the trash-can icon in the user interface of the Macintosh operating system-from the perspective of a single (also still evolving) human user.},

  title={Inner Speech and Extended Consciousness: a Model based on Damasio’s Theory of Emotions}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Recently, the interest in robots capable of experiencing empathy and displaying emotions has grown. This trend can be attributed to the pervasive presence of robots in many environments, such as homes, offices, museums, and hospitals, that require more empathic and reliable human-machine relationships. Recent studies demonstrated that providing the robot with the ability to think aloud improves humans’ trust in machines, as they can understand the underlying reasoning of the artifact, what conclusions it can draw, and why and how. This work integrates a robot’s inner speech mechanism with Damasio’s theory of emotions to make the robot functionally conscious of its emotional experience, leading to a computational model of Extended Consciousness, SUSAN (Self-dialogue Utility in Simulating Artificial Emotions). Damasio claims that emotions originate within the body and precede and influence the reasoning processes that make the person aware of them. According to his theory, Extended Consciousness refers to the humans’ cognitive processes that make the humans themselves aware of the physiological experiences of emotions purged by an external stimulus. SUSAN models the bodily emotional experience and simulates the awareness of the emergent emotion by using inner speech. The model is presented, and the initial results related to a use case are discussed.},

  title={A Comparative Study of Gaze Estimation Models}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={The eye-mind hypothesis suggests that people tend to look at what they’re actively thinking about, forming the basis of eye and gaze tracking. This concept is gaining attention in deep learning due to its broad applications. The use of AI alongside webcams to monitor eye movements is increasingly popular and expected to grow further. This is further emphasized by recent data showing a growing use of eye gaze estimation techniques, especially in marketing research, e-commerce, and educational tools. Accordingly, multiple previous research works have developed various eye and gaze estimation and tracking models. However, one main limitation is that many models use their own datasets for performance evaluation as well as having different underlying computing resources that are used during training. Consequently, it becomes harder to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of these models. To that end, this work aims at providing a comprehensive comparative study of three well-established eye gaze estimation models, namely OpenGaze, GazeRefineNet, ODABE, and FAZE models using a unified evaluation framework. Experimental results conducted using GazeCapture dataset illustrate that OpenGaze model achieves a mean error of 2.27 cm mean error, GazeRefineNet model achieves 1.91 cm, ODABE model achieves 3.46 cm, and FAZE model achieves 2.9 cm. This indicates that GazeRefineNet outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy while having comparable computational complexity.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Network Exchange Objects (NEO) is a new software framework designed to facilitate development of complex natural or built distributed system models, where the system model is represented as a graph, through which currencies (e.g., coding information) flux. This paper introduces "system-level hypothesis (SLH) testing" as a form of computational thinking that will drive integration of computational and empirical sciences to promote efficient, self- correcting inquiry into the operations and behavior of complex systems. To demonstrate NEO, we examine the problem of maximizing the productivity of a software development organization by measuring growth in the total lines of code (LOC) contributed by developers. We develop a software framework (NEO) that allows rapid creation of model variants representing alternative SLHs. NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as "complex adaptive hierarchical networks" (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). Modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime. Thus, NEO is a simulation framework that can be used in any domain of expertise, where systems are represented as interdependent entities that store and flux multiple currencies.},

Fifty undergraduate students have created nine game based learning applications for a special school in two semesters. This special school caters to children who are severely mentally handicapped, and their day-to-day training consists of repetitive tasks that are designed to help them to express their needs to a certain degree. We will present (1) our timeline and detailed setting of our course which is different from traditional lecture setting.

  abstract={We began our journey with the goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the remaining billions. We gravitated towards providing neighborhood connectivity in developing and rural regions. Businesses saw an opportunity and local government began to value blanket city-wide coverage. But success was not inevitable. Deployments failed and critics questioned the promises. Perhaps the technology was not ready for prime time. So we began "fixing" the technology, part of which included revisiting governmental policies around spectrum allocation. The US government listened and in a landmark ruling on Nov. 4, the FCC voted to open the unused low frequency bands for unlicensed use. In this talk, the author discussed the evolution of our thinking on how to achieve open pervasive Internet connectivity. The author highlight promising new directions that are full of interesting challenges. The author discussed solutions that researchers are developing and show their trajectory. The author's objective is to present what the author believe is the new frontier of wireless networking and ubiquitous Internet, at the intersection of cognitive systems, mesh networking, and white spaces. The author challenged the audience into taking on new technical problems and thinking about new business models, which will lead us to success in our original goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the masses, bridging the digital divide, and enabling exciting new applications and services in the process.},

  pages={1175-1191},
  abstract={The ability to recognize emotion is one of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence, an aspect of human intelligence that has been argued to be even more important than mathematical and verbal intelligences. This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

  title={A Cognitive Model of Improvisation in Emergency Management}, 
  year={2007},
  volume={37},
  number={4},
  pages={547-561},
  abstract={An enduring characteristic of emergencies is the need for near-simultaneous development and deployment of new management procedures. This need can arise with the onset of highly novel problems and the need to act quickly-factors that reduce opportunities for extensive planning in managing the emergency. As a result, decision makers in emergencies must be prepared to improvise. By understanding the cognitive processes in improvisation, organizations can better learn how to plan for, manage, and learn from improvised action. To help create this understanding, this paper reviews and synthesizes prior results on improvisation in the art of jazz, exploring how these results may be applied to improvisation in emergency management. A theory of improvisation in emergency management is then developed and expressed as a cognitive model. The modelpsilas implementation in computer-executable code is then reviewed, along with an illustration of how the model improvises in an emergency situation. Finally, implications of this model and opportunities for future research are presented.},

  abstract={Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and evolutionary computation are the core methodologies of soft computing (SC). SC is causing a paradigm shift in engineering and science fields since it can solve problems that have not been able to be solved by traditional analytic methods. In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation, flexible knowledge acquisition, and flexible knowledge processing, which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use of SC. Our paper intends to remove the gap between theory and practice and attempts to learn how to apply soft computing practically to industrial systems from examples/analogy, reviewing many application papers.},

  pages={393-407},
  abstract={The notion of the necessary criticality (both with respect to path and to activity) of a network with imprecisely defined (by means of intervals or fuzzy intervals) activity duration times is introduced and analyzed. It is shown, in the interval case, that both the problem of asserting whether a given path is necessarily critical and the problem of determining an arbitrary necessarily critical path (more exactly, a subnetwork covering all the necessarily critical paths) are easy. The corresponding solution algorithms are proposed. However, the problem of evaluating whether a given activity is necessarily critical does not seem to be so easy. Certain conditions are formulated which, in some situations (but not in all possible situations), allow the necessary criticality of activities to be evaluated. The results obtained for networks with interval activity duration times are generalized to the case of networks with fuzzy activity duration times. Two effective algorithms for calculating the degree of necessary criticality of a fixed path, as well as an algorithm for determining the paths that are necessarily critical to the maximum degree, are proposed.},

It was organized in the context of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS 2015). The goal of this competition was to set a common platform for evaluation of the recent development in sclera segmentation and also to attract the attention of researchers to this new area. In this regard, we have prepared a Multi-Angle Sclera Dataset (MASD) version 1. It is comprised of 2624 RGB images taken from both the eyes of 82 identities. In other words, it consists of images of 164 (82*2) different eyes. Moreover, we have prepared manual segmentation masks of these images to create the baseline. We have, furthermore, adopted precision and recall-based statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness and the ranks of the competing algorithms. To summarize, ten participants registered for the competition, and among them four participants submitted their algorithms/ systems. The results achieved by these algorithms reflect noteworthy developments in the literature of sclera segmentation employing cutting edge segmentation techniques. Along with the algorithm of the four competing teams and their results, the MASD version 1 dataset will also be freely available for research purposes from the organizer's website.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (Chat-GPT) and related Generative AI models are leading a paradigm shift in the acceptance and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all disciplines and industry sectors. Despite the criticisms of an ‘intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth’, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.},

  abstract={The recent progress in generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought about a transformation in the field of education. Conversational LLM services, such as Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT, offer students access to many abilities such as summarization and generation of text and code, and on-demand replies to questions on expert topics. In this paper, we observe ChatGPT to explore how LLM services impact learning and instruction in higher education. First, we mapped the capabilities of the system by reviewing the grey literature on ChatGPT and using the system ourselves for two months. Second, we selected a Bachelor level computer science curriculum from a Finnish university, and examined the impact of ChatGPT on the offered courses. As an outcome of this study, we highlight 13 implications for students' learning in higher education, and discuss the contemporary future of AI-assisted learning in universities and beyond.},

  abstract={This paper presents a simple approach for implementing Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) - a paradigm in which humans directly intervene in fitness evaluation - in the field of musical melody generation. Music is an art and, as all kinds of art, it involves creativity. However, creativity is still a human capability. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based application has been developed and tested. The initial population was generated according to Zipf's Law. Simple melodies, obtained in a few iterations, can be quickly transformed into complete and interesting songs.},

  abstract={This research is about how to create an educational video game whose main purpose is to stimulate logical and spatial reasoning of children. For this goal, we have applied an incremental methodology in order to be able to produce a Massive Multiplayer Online Game. With the intention of incorporating operations necessary for cognitive development and simultaneously to control the mechanics of the video game, we applied Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Agents, and modern 3D technology approaches such as Unity 3D Game Engine and Photon Cloud. Validation of our solution has been performed by running several tests in public schools. The results demonstrate that this educational software stimulates the cognitive development of children.},

  number={1},
  pages={236-246},
  abstract={Pictorial visualizations portray data with figurative messages and approximate the audience to the visualization. Previous research on pictorial visualizations has developed authoring tools or generation systems, but their methods are restricted to specific visualization types and templates. Instead, we propose to augment pictorial visualization authoring with visual style transfer, enabling a more extensible approach to visualization design. To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.},
