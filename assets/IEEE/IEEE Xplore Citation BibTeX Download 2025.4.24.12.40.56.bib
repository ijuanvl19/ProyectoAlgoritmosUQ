  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Benchmarking is not only about making comparisons but, through these, learning lessons to improve actual performance or knowledge. Comparing modelling paradigms based only on the conceptual model specifications is not enough; rather a well-defined benchmarking process and the execution of experiments are required. A benchmarking strategy is applied to three models of an oil refinery supply chain, using the agent-based or equation-based paradigm. Despite the different paradigms, the models share the same assumptions and model boundaries and an attempt is made to provide same initial conditions and stochastics. The benchmarking process shows that clear definitions of the modelling paradigms are needed to avoid confusion and to enable mining of specific and guiding conclusions from the benchmarking studies. Agent-based models and equation-based models rely on different modelling attributes: The first are mostly identified by the model elements (i.e. individuals) while the latter are mostly identified by the system description elements (i.e. equations). We present a way to visualize this and to add nuance to the choice of labels to allow for the conclusions of the benchmarking study to be generalised beyond the models that are compared, to learn about the advantages and shortcomings of modelling paradigms. Finally, some misconceptions regarding agent-based modelling are identified. The lessons learnt apply to supply chain domain but are extensible to other domains.},

  pages={44-51},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a hierarchically iterate model of human conceptualization and cognition. Based on the theory of dual structure of cognition and related physiological evidence, we firstly propose the notion of concept space in human brain and a corresponding conceptualization model. Conceptualization is the process of forming concepts in our brain. The concept of cognition process is then defined to introduce our unified iterative cognition model. The hierarchy within the iterative cognition is the logic of human cognition. Some visual cognition examples are employed to investigate our cognition model. With our conceptualization and cognition model, the processes of auditory cognition, visual cognition and more over, language understanding could be explained under a unified theoretical framework. Separate papers describing specific usages of the framework will be published.},

  abstract={Owing to its massive potential, the field of Artificial Intelligence is booming at an unprecedented rate. With the increase in efficiency and accuracy in prediction, classification, translation, and other traditional tasks, deep learning has also witnessed a surge in applications in various other sectors, one of them being music generation. This paper provides a brief introduction to the process of creating fresh new music from a collection of existing music as the sample, using deep learning architectures and training techniques. The creation of music using automated processes in the absence of human intelligence is not a fresh proposal and has been influencing human curiosity for a long time. Being an innovative and complex venture, it poses certain unorthodox challenges which are needed to be addressed. This paper focuses on the analysis of these challenges and explores the scope of this fascinating pursuit.},

  abstract={The purpose of this article is to historize the definition of computer science, particularly the characteristic ambiguity of the discipline toward the computer. This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.},

  year={2023},

  pages={34-41},
  abstract={A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.},

  abstract={Graphics has always been a requisite form of communication for engineering practice. The history of major engineering accomplishments is replete with examples of graphical communications: from styli etchings on clay tablets to near-recent blueprint drawings. In the last two decades, engineering graphics instruction has been significantly influenced by the advancement of computers and other new technologies. During this short span, the discipline has gone from teaching manual drafting and pencil drawings to the use of 3-D computer modeling and simulation software. This paper briefly reviews the evolution of graphical communication in engineering practice, and focuses on the current status of graphical communication in the engineering curriculum. This report is bolstered by results of a recent survey conducted at the 2003 annual meeting of the Engineering Design Graphics Division of ASEE. The survey proposed an extensive list of student outcomes for engineering graphical communication, as mandated by the new ABET EC2000 outcomes requirement criterion 3 (g): "an ability to communicate effectively." Graphics faculty ranked these graphics student outcomes, and accompanying performance criteria, on level of importance in the modern curriculum. The results represent a consensus of current thinking on engineering graphical communication education.},

  abstract={Food processing demands a considerable and continuous energy supply and the rise in the price of electricity in South Africa has put much pressure on the industry. This has forced a re-think and development of alternative energy efficiency technology. In South Africa's cold storage chain the entire refrigeration system is among the most energy-intensive areas, but also offers opportunity for short and long term saving. It also provides an opportunity for enhancement of sustainable development and cold chain management. This paper presents a combination of three efficient technologies in those areas: (1) Airflow pattern optimisation through a computer assisted simulation model in which overall energy efficiency of cooling facilities is dependent not only on the energy generation efficiency of the refrigeration system, but also utilisation efficiency of all cooling facilities. Optimal airflow pattern of a cold room would move heat effectively to a refrigeration system, hence increasing both energy efficiency and refrigeration distribution. (2) Variable speed drive (VSDs) technology on evaporator fans motors: VSDs reduce motor electricity consumption by 30-60%; other benefits include prolonging equipment life through motor speed adjustments according to load. (3) Minimising heat transmission load by heat conduction transfer - coloured and shaded external walls being a major factor. Such technologies saved energy, thus reducing cold chain facilities' demand. The system was also cost-efficient and, inter-alia, research detailed in this paper contributed towards alleviating South Africa's energy problems.},

  abstract={A very interesting and promising numerical method of solving systems of ordinary differential equations based on Taylor series has appeared. The potential of the Taylor series has been exposed by many practical experiments and a way of detection and solution of large systems of ordinary differential equations has been found. Generally speaking, a stiff system contains several components, some of them are heavily suppressed while the rest remain almost unchanged. This feature forces the used method to choose an extremely small integration step and the progress of the computation may become very slow. There are many (implicit) methods for solving stiff systems of ODE’s, from the most simple such as implicit Euler method to more sophisticated (implicit Runge-Kutta methods) and finally the general linear methods. Usually a quite complicated auxiliary system of equations has to be solved in each step. These facts lead to immense amount of work to be done in each step of the computation. These are the reasons why one has to think twice before using the stiff solver and to decide between the stiff and non-stiff solver.},

  abstract={College counselors are an important part of the faculty of colleges and universities, the backbone of the ideological and political education of college students, and the main force in the work of college students. The 21st century we live in is a highly intelligent era. With the continuous emergence of intelligent computing as a typical technical means in contemporary network technology, the relationship between intelligent computing and people&#x0027;s life and work is getting closer and closer. However, college counselors are also facing many new problems and challenges. Therefore, how to improve the use of intelligent computing and better improve the competence of counselors has become a difficult problem for colleges and universities. Based on this, this article launched a research on the competency training ability of college counselors based on intelligent computing. This article uses behavioral incident interview method, literature analysis method and questionnaire survey method to carry out research. Through interviews with counselors, the competency characteristics of counselors are obtained, and the competency model of counselors is established. By consulting the literature, compiling questionnaires, designing a complete set of questionnaires in line with the research, and issuing questionnaires to 60&#x0025; of college counselors and teachers to obtain the most authentic data. Collect relevant data through questionnaire surveys, and then enter the collected data into the database for data analysis. By consulting related materials, using publicly published papers and works at home and abroad as references, we can obtain basic theoretical support and background materials, as well as the current status and development level of the research on the competence of counselors. The survey results show that counselors have a strong understanding of work. Generally, 45&#x0025; are familiar with them, 18&#x0025; are relatively familiar, and few are very familiar. 40&#x0025; of counselors think they have average competence. 44 &#x0025; of counselors voluntarily signed up and wanted to participate in training to improve themselves. 51&#x0025; of counselors believe that the best time for a training session is half a day. Regarding the training goals, only a small number of instructors have clear training goals. It can be seen that the research on the competence training ability of college counselors is of extremely high value.},

  abstract={The present work provides a solid understanding on the challenges and opportunities of visual analytics (VA) use for the development of electrical distribution systems (EDS) of vehicles. First, the need for a VA-based software platform is justified to address the associated information overload and problem complexity. Later, a detailed background on the preceding use of VA in electrical systems as well in the automotive industry is provided. Based on the previous context and agile software implementation, specific guidelines for the development of a novel and functional VA-based computational tool are then provided to appropriately visualize, analyze and simulate in-car EDS.},

  abstract={Different computational tools may offer teachers and students distinct opportunities in representing, exploring and solving mathematical tasks. In this context, we illustrate that the use of dynamic software (Cabri Geometry) helped high school teachers to think of and represent a particular task dynamically. In this process, the teachers had the opportunity of identifying, exploring and supporting mathematical relations that emerged during the solution of the task. We distinguish problem-solving episodes that teachers exhibited while understanding and representing the task, thinking of a solution plan, searching and presenting mathematical arguments and looking for connections.},

  title={Computational Methods to Predict Suicide Ideation among Adolescents}, 
  year={2022},

  abstract={Suicide has been a prominent cause of death worldwide, regardless of age, sex, geography, and so on, and predominantly suicide among teens, increased as the years have passed. Suicide ideation, suicide risk, suicide attempts have been studied extensively, and the most common cause has been identified as depression, followed by familial concerns, hereditary factors, stress, avoidance fear, and a variety of other variables. When visited by a doctor, most adolescents are unaware of their mental state and hence do not take action on their own or are not assisted by family or peer members to overcome their fear of social stigma or the treatment they must undergo. According to popular belief, early treatment and detection are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of suicide. As a result, the focus of this study is to illustrate some of the computational strategies utilized in deep learning and machine learning fields to detect kids at risk of suicide},
