  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress research paper reflects on findings from a program evaluation of a nationwide professional development (PD) initiative designed to enhance computational thinking (CT) skills among teachers in Colombia's public schools. Evaluating CT education programs presents challenges due to the limited research on the validity and reliability of data collection tools. In addition, evaluation of PD programs in CT often overlooks affective factors and fails to align with program outcomes beyond the training context, leading to insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. This study seeks to identify the factors that influence the effective implementation of CT teaching practices and contribute to the body of knowledge of professional development programs. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted pre-post surveys to assess changes in teachers' knowledge, followed by realist-based focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into participants' experiences and the factors influencing classroom implementation. The primary contribution of this paper is providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving changes in teachers' practices after participating in a CT-focused PD program in a middle-income country. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in teachers' CT knowledge post-intervention. Qualitative findings highlight the importance of teachers' confidence in their CT knowledge and the need for comprehensive school support for effective CT integration.},

  abstract={One of the most important skills for a biochemist these days is to be able to visualize a protein, find a ligand binding site, and show the three-dimensional interactions with the coordinated amino acid residues. It is important to educate a modern student how to benefit from the up-to-date scientific data and software. It is known that the primary structure of protein is of primary information content; however, the tertiary structure is more conserved. Biochemistry students are educated in a traditional way giving an importance to developing fundamental skills as well as critical thinking. In this article, we demonstrate educational approaches that incorporate computational methods in the course Biochemistry A–CHEM 370. This approach is developed at Loyola University Chicago and is based on a pedagogical method developed at Orenburg State Medical University.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.},

  abstract={Computers are often used as tools to design, implement, and even visualize a variety of narrative forms. Many researchers and artists are now further attempting to engage the computer actively throughout the development of the narrative itself. Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative , meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more specifically the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the field of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely benefit the field of automated space generation with the strengths in the field of automated plot generation.},

  abstract={Can a robot think like a human being? Scientists in recent years have been trying to achieve this dream, and we are also committed to this same goal. In this paper, we use an example of throwing the ball into the basket to make the robots process with human-like thinking behavior. Such thinking behavior adopted in this paper is divided into two modes: fast and slow. The fast mode belongs to the intuitional reaction, and the slow mode represents the complicated cogitation in human brain. This fascinating human thinking concept is inspired by the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, which explains the process of the human brain. In addition, the psychology theories proposed in this book are also adopted to realize the thinking algorithms, and our experiments verify that the thinking mode of human beings is reasonable and effective in robots.},

  abstract={This paper explores the evolving landscape of training for archival professionals in the context of big data and emerging technologies. By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs.},

  abstract={In today's data-driven world, the importance of data literacy is paramount. However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of tailored courses and the intimidating nature of existing tools for begin-ners. Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of software engineering education for young learners by offering a comprehensive framework, the data action educational framework (DAEF), and a data science toolkit that enables DAEF by empowering learners to create original data-driven mobile apps.},

  number={},
  pages={33041-33050},
  abstract={This study investigates the relationship between two related computational thinking practices: data practices and computational problem-solving practices in acquiring related computational thinking practices during a first-year undergraduate engineering course. While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.},

  abstract={For robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), complex decision-making, interpretation, and adaptive planning processes are great challenges. These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software. Several interaction scenarios are implemented to monitor and evaluate the model's performance.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) is a tool that can favor teamwork, stimulate creativity, and the ability to solve students' problems through the process of assembling and programming robots. In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can explore common, vast and unsafe places at low cost. They could transform multiple sectors from photography to farming to city planning. However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students. Our 1 hour workshop focused on breadth and was received well.},

  abstract={Several practical engineering optimization problems are computationally demanding, requiring a large amount of computer time, processing power, and memory. These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.},

The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, particularly in achieving notable improvements in solving accuracy for complex problems.},

  abstract={Computational thinking and computer science are instrumental in learning how to creatively solve problems and develop thought out solutions. Over the years, workshops have been held to provide high school teachers the ability to teach high school students computer science, however not much has been done for middle school teachers. Funded by Google, the three day CS Educator Professional Development Workshop for Middle School Teachers at Kean University brought together teachers to learn about key computer science concepts and work with tools that were previously not known to them, such as Scratch, the Makey Makey tool kit, and the Cue robot. The results of this research find that middle school teachers need access to curriculum materials and digital tools in order to successfully teach computer science to their students. Furthermore, more work should be done to get middle school teachers access to materials and lesson plans aimed at teaching middle school students.},

  abstract={How to foster not only Software Programming Skill (SPS) but also Computational Thinking Ability (CTA) of students becomes more important. However, students cannot immediately understand learning problems and statuses in terms of SPS and CTA even though Scratch tool can facilitate the programming learning. Therefore, a scheme of Web-based Learning Activity Integrated with Scratch Tool (WeLaS) is proposed to assist learners. In WeLaS, students can learn the programming concepts and knowledge by sequential learning content, hands-on practice the coding skills by embedded Scratch tool, address the task by online prompts, and reflect the learning status by diagnostic report. Consequently, WeLaS can be expected to assist students in achieving the high learning performance.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a skill that is considered essential for the future generations. Because of this it should be incorporated into the curricula as soon as possible. Many robots can be programmed using graphical languages or physical blocks instead of writing code. This makes programming more accessible for the youngest programmers. Looking to extend the programming activities to preschool students, we present a novel approach that allows to program a mobile robot, Robotito, by changing its environment. We describe the architecture of Robotito, software used to program its interaction with the environment, and developed behaviours. Moreover, Robotito exports his sensors and actuators using ROS standard mechanisms and is modelled in Gazebo allowing it to be used in research and undergraduate school courses providing researchers an autonomous and safety mobile platform, which can be integrated with any system using ROS.},

  abstract={A pod of ten unattended “behind-the-glass” computer kiosks has been running at the Raglan Road Multipurpose Centre in Grahamstown for more than three years. The goal is to enhance computational thinking skills, and to provide logic, mathematical, reading and computer literacy skills via edutainment and fun. The technology is explicitly engineered so that usage is not dependent on having willing teachers as supervisors. Initially targeted at 7-13 year old children, we've had to make adaptations for younger children from the on-site pre-primary school. We describe the innovative mechanism that allows unattended access while securing and protecting our systems. We give a brief overview of the technology and content on the kiosks, the implementation, and some observations about usage. Unusually, the project was conceived and initiated from a technical perspective, and we discuss some issues that have arisen around maintenance and division of responsibilities between the parties involved.},

  abstract={For a long time, pedagogy has been a social practice based on direct experiences, and many traditional teaching methods have formed. These methods were not supported by a scientific theoretical system and could not meet the fast-changing social needs. Neuroeducation is an empirical science, and an interdisciplinary subject that applies the latest theoretical advances in human brain and psychology to pedagogy. This paper explores the connection between neuroeducation and the teaching practice through the study of the latest theoretical achievements in neuroscience, cognitive neurology and psychology. Guided by theory of neuroeducation, the course content, the teaching strategy and new learning methods are proposed to improve the teaching quality of computer programming courses, while improving students' computational thinking ability.},
