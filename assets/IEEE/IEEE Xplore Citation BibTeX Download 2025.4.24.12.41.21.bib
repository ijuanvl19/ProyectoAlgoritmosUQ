  abstract={Developing database (DB) and data warehouse (DW) applications passes through three main modeling phases imposed by the ANSI/SPARC architecture: conceptual, logical and physical. This architecture creates two different actors: (i) conceptual designers and Database Administrators (DBA). The first actor collects user requirements, chooses the relevant diagrams for designing the conceptual model (or the logical model). The DBA ensures the performance, the maintenance and the tuning of the final application. Most of the tasks performed by these two actors are complex and time consuming for a majority of companies. Recently, some academic and industry research efforts are moving towards truly zero-administration of DW by proposing tools (advisors) substituting some tasks of DBA. One of the functionalities of these tools is to propose recommendations in choosing optimization structures such as indexing, materialized views, etc. They do not guarantee robust solutions. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary economical model for DB /DW application. Instead of substituting the DBA by advisors, we propose to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers like selecting optimization structures. First, we propose to connect user requirements to the conceptual model of the target application. Secondly, based on the analysis of requirements, SQL queries are identified and then used to select optimization structures. Finally, a feasibility of our approach is tested through the selection of bitmap join indexes based on user requirements.},

  year={2022},
  volume={33},
  number={12},
  pages={7621-7631},
  abstract={Spiking neural networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically inspired learning principles than those in standard artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system’s intelligent nature.},

  abstract={We can think of the set of propositions describing the outcome of measurements of physical systems as a set of propositions of the form “Measurand X had (didn't have) value V at time t”. In classical physics, this system of propositions has a Boolean logic (BL). In quantum mechanics, this system is isomorphic to the algebra, C(H), of closed linear subspaces of (equivalently, the system of linear operators on (observables in)) in a Hilbert space and is isomorphic to an ortholattice (OL). A consequence of the existence of non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics is that QL does not satisfy the BL distribution law. Quantum logicians have thus paid much attention to "quasi"- distributive theorems, one of the better known of which is the Marsden-Herman theorem (MHT). Informally, the MHT states that if there is a four-element cyclic chain of commuting elements in an orthomodular lattice, the distributive law holds for those elements. Here I provide a Mathematica-based automated deduction of the MHT.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={School graduates of technology profiles classes are often seen as the most prepared potential applicants for engineering universities. Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies. The outcome may be useful for early schoolchildren involvement in innovative engineering initiatives through participation in research projects and STEM Olympiads including multi-language educational events.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={A longitudinal study was conducted in a New Zealand secondary school to investigate the immediate and longer-term challenges and opportunities of a technology-supported learning initiative. A ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) initiative called for a stronger connect with digital technology in formal educational settings in 2012. This was indeed much ahead of its time, as now evident from worldwide move towards digital education in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tracked transformations within learning and teaching for over five years. At the inception of the idea, there was much resistance from parents and other stakeholders; however, the BYOD initiative ultimately showcased a very successful example of technology-supported teaching and learning initiative for other New Zealand schools. Our investigation primarily focused on one of the critical indicators for the success of such an initiative, the digital divide. The digital divide is particularly important because of the level of attention and dialogue this BYOD topic gathered across New Zealand. Initial discourses (over newspapers, radio and television) suggested that this initiative would be damaging in view of existing digital divides across societies and the overall public opinion outweighed the potential positives from such an initiative. As part of our five-year study, we investigated some of the key concerns around the digital divide issue in the context of such a technology-supported learning initiative. One of the key enablers of this study was integration of two frameworks, to enable the cross-examination of relationships between various sources of social cognitive abilities related to an individual’s information literacy, motivational and behavioral aspects. That is, how skill development, knowledge acquisition, and changes in personal and behavioral aspects impact self-efficacy levels as a consequence of BYOD strategies. The resulting framework is especially relevant in post-COVID-19 times, since technology-driven remote education delivery formats are now being touted as the new norm. Our framework will therefore provide much value to policy-makers in establishing inclusive educational policies.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={97430-97443},
  abstract={Temporal sentence grounding aims to ground a query sentence into a specific segment of the video. Previous methods follow the common equally-spaced frame selection mechanism for appearance and motion modeling, which fails to consider redundant and distracting visual information. There is also no guarantee that all meaningful frames can be obtained. Moreover, this task needs to detect the location clues precisely from both spatial and temporal dimensions, but the relationship between spatial-temporal semantic information and query sentence is still unexplored in existing methods. Inspired by human thinking patterns, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Spatial-Temporal Relationship Inference (CFSTRI) network to progressively localize fine-grained activity segments. Firstly, we present a coarse-grained crucial frame selection module, where the query-guided local difference context modeling from adjacent frames helps discriminate all the coarse boundary locations relevant to the sentence semantics, and the soft assignment vector of locally aggregated descriptors are employed to enhance the representation of selected frames. Then, we develop a fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching module to refine the coarse boundaries, which disentangles the spatial and temporal semantic information from query sentence to guide the excavation of visual grounding clues of corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, we devise a gated graph convolution network to incorporate the spatial-temporal semantic information by leveraging a gate operation to highlight frames referred to by the query sentence from spatial and temporal dimensions, and propagate fused information on the graph. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CFSTRI significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.},

The system will show the possibilities of getting the disease at an early stage, which will improve the health state of the patients. This will be done using machine learning techniques. The used dataset has 86 records, which was obtained from the Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP) 2014 Schizophrenia Classification Kaggle Challenge. The used techniques in this paper are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayesian (NB). The highest accuracy was 90.6977% reached by using SVM, RF, and NB techniques while ANN technique reached 88.3721% accuracy. The obtained accuracies are reached by using 204 features.

By CLSO-NPFC, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computing mechanization, automation and intelligence are constructed uniformly and tentatively, and the typical deep learning model neural computing architecture (DLM-NCA) in CLSO-NPFC is designed for the prediction of calling liner handling volume that is measured by container units rather than twenty-feet equivalent unit. A typical regional container terminal along the coast of China is selected to implement, execute and evaluate the DLM-NCA, and the DLM-NCA shows the agile, efficient and robust performance for forecasting with the low and stable computation consumption. It demonstrates the feasibility, credibility and practicality of the abstract principles, design paradigms and computing architecture in CLSO-NPFC preliminarily.},

  number={12},
  pages={2618-2626},
  abstract={The two visual cortical streams hypothesis, which suggests object properties (what) are processed separately from spatial properties (where), has a longstanding history, and much evidence has accumulated to support its conjectures. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, conflicting evidence has mounted that demands some explanation and modification. For example, existence of (1) shape activities (fMRI) or shape selectivities (physiology) in dorsal stream, similar to ventral stream; likewise, spatial activations (fMRI) or spatial selectivities (physiology) in ventral stream, similar to dorsal stream; (2) multiple segregated subpathways within a stream. In addition, the idea of segregation of various aspects of multiple objects in a scene raises questions about how these properties of multiple objects are then properly re-associated or bound back together to accurately perceive, remember, or make decisions. We will briefly review the history of the two-stream hypothesis, discuss competing accounts that challenge current thinking, and propose ideas on why the brain has segregated pathways. We will present ideas based on our own data using artificial neural networks (1) to reveal encoding differences for what and where that arise in a two-pathway neural network, (2) to show how these encoding differences can clarify previous conflicting findings, and (3) to elucidate the computational advantages of segregated pathways. Furthermore, we will discuss whether neural networks need to have multiple subpathways for different visual attributes. We will also discuss the binding problem (how to correctly associate the different attributes of each object together when there are multiple objects each with multiple attributes in a scene) and possible solutions to the binding problem. Finally, we will briefly discuss problems and limitations with existing models and potential fruitful future directions.},

  abstract={The purpose of this research is to realize a "co-creation system". Co-creation means co-emergence of real-time coordination by sharing subjective space and time between different persons. Human communication with emergent reality like this is essential to improve communicability in social systems, and we assume such communication needs two kinds of information process at the same time. One is explicit communication such as the transmission of messages and the other is implicit embodied interaction such as the sympathy and direct experience. The conventional IT system mainly covers the former process but we have been pointing out the importance of the latter process. Especially, this implicit process is related with rhythmic interaction between humans, such as entrainment of body motion. From this background, using these implicit and explicit processing complementarily, we are developing co-creative man-machine interfaces and communication media. We think this dual-processing based new technology will be effective for recovering human linkage and mutual-reliability that has been weakened in modern IT society.},

However, methods for involving directly the power brokers in the process are not well developed, and yet the ownership of the strategic thinking which follows from thinking about alternative futures is crucial for successful strategic change. The paper presents a method for involving the senior management team that succeeds because of its involvement of a group decision support system (GDSS). The method described has been used in a wide variety of organizations-public and private, large and small. After describing the role of thinking about alternative futures in strategy making and its relationship to stakeholder analysis and management, the paper goes on to describe the method and use of the GDSS, and finally considers some of the reasons why the use of a GDSS is helpful.},

Recently App Inventor is gaining momentum and traction in China at a very high speed and is expected to grow even faster in the future. Teachers using App Inventor for teaching face the problem of having to go through a very high number of App Inventor apps without any way to catalogue them.

This study examines work by researchers and practitioners in Mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. The state of Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of STEM employment. With half of the public school children identified as African American, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing. Assessments from a K-12 teacher professional development programs will be discussed, in addition to outcomes from one year of a workforce development program.},

  abstract={Building on the success of the first North-South cross-continental collaborative educational robotics mission held in November 2015 [1], this paper presents a practical model for scaling the event up into a program for developing countries, particularly those of Africa, where the first edition took place. Past participants in Remote Rescue Thymio II (R2T2) missions, students and educators alike, have shared qualitative observations about its positive educational impact, notably in the areas of Collaboration, Communication, Critical thinking, Creative problem solving, Computational thinking, and Cross-cultural exchange. The proposed framework for delivering R2T2 missions has been adapted to Africa, being specifically designed to tackle the critical challenges of internet connectivity, teacher training and program costs. In so doing, it strives to pave the way for collaboration with partners in African educational ecosystems and North-South funding bodies that share the vision of making collaborative STEM education more accessible and attractive to teachers and schoolchildren around the world.},

  abstract={Visualization researchers, developers, practitioners, and educators routinely work across traditional discipline boundaries, oftentimes in teams of people that come from a diverse blend of backgrounds, using visualizations as a common language for collaboration. There is a looming global workforce shortage in the computational science and high-tech space, primarily due to a disconnect between population demographics and the demographics of those educated to fill these jobs. The visualization community is uniquely positioned to bring a fresh approach to making diversity and inclusion fundamental tenets that are necessary rather than desirable.},

  abstract={This paper describes the experience to teach mathematics in the electro-mechanical technical course applying a computer-aided approach. Instead of give a bunch of equations and a calculator to the students, as it is usual in technical courses, we offer them the Octave, which is a numerical computational tool, and the mathematical concepts involved, in order to them find the solution of applied problems. Despite the deficiencies the students in technical courses have in their formation, we could notice that their vision regarding mathematics has changed after discover that there is more than calculators to help them finding the solution. The approach was initially applied with a group of 25 mature students, which passed by a flawed basic educational system and stayed away from school for a long time.},

  pages={135365-135376},
  abstract={Recent research has shed light on integrating cutting-edge technologies in various organisations to support daily operations in the digital age. However, this implementation has resulted in undesirable consequences, notably contributing to global warming and climate change, primarily due to unchecked carbon emissions. Higher Educational Institutions are expected to lead by example in reducing global carbon emissions. Despite some institutions’ efforts in this regard, multiple studies suggest that progress could be expedited through digital technology, leaving room for improvement. Numerous Higher Educational Institutions still need sustainable practices within their building infrastructure. Hence, this research project was developed to create an intelligent model for monitoring the carbon footprint of buildings within Higher Educational Institutions. The study focused on the Bandung Institute of Technology facilities, which encountered similar challenges stemming from various aspects contributing to the overall carbon footprint. This research effectively managed energy consumption by implementing design thinking, encompassing electricity and water usage, and reducing emissions. Furthermore, the application of this model provided valuable insights into both current and projected energy consumption and emission production. It also assessed the sustainability status of these buildings and enhanced the efficiency of information dissemination in energy reporting processes. This, in turn, facilitated the implementation of proactive measures for emission management not only at the Bandung Institute of Technology but also in other Higher Educational Institution buildings sharing similar characteristics.},

  title={A Linguistic Metric for Consensus Reaching Processes Based on ELICIT Comprehensive Minimum Cost Consensus Models}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={31},

  pages={1676-1688},
  abstract={Linguistic group decision making (LiGDM) aims at solving decision situations involving human decision makers (DMs) whose opinions are modeled by using linguistic information. To achieve agreed solutions that increase DMs' satisfaction toward the collective solution, linguistic consensus reaching processes (LiCRPs) have been developed. These LiCRPs aim at suggesting DMs to change their original opinions to increase the group consensus degree, computed by a certain consensus measure. In recent years, these LiCRPs have been a prolific research line, and consequently, numerous proposals have been introduced in the specialized literature. However, we have pointed out the nonexistence of objective metrics to compare these models and decide which one presents the best performance for each LiGDM problem. Therefore, this article aims at introducing a metric to evaluate the performance of LiCRPs that takes into account the resulting consensus degree and the cost of modifying DMs' initial opinions. Such a metric is based on a linguistic comprehensive minimum cost consensus (CMCC) model based on Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation information that models DMs' hesitancy and provides accurate Computing with Words processes. In addition, the linguistic CMCC optimization model is linearized to speed up the computational model and improve its accuracy.},

And they orient our present and future selves: how to think, what to say, how to act, and how to make sense of whatever we encounter.},
