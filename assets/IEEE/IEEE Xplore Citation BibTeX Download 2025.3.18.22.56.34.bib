  abstract={As the source of enhancing product competitions, creative design has various implementation manners, among which innovative computation is an important way. Immune computing, a new kind of intelligent computation approach drawing inspiration from the vertebrate immune system, has strong capabilities of computation. In this paper, some excellent characteristics of immune computing, such as distribution and parallelity, self-organization and self-adaptation, global optimization, robustness, and emergence, are analyzed in detailed to demonstrate that immune computing is a novel research approach for creative design firstly. Next, a scheme of creative design based on immune computing is proposed and corresponding research framework consisting of three levels, i.e. immune computing, creative design and immune creative design, is established. Finally, some key techniques of implementing creative design based on immune computing are briefly discussed.},

  abstract={With quick upgrading of knowledge and high demand for all-round talents at the age of information, the integration of computer multimedia into college English course has altered traditional teaching model. The teaching focus is converted to learning process from content; teacher becomes the organizer and manager of class, the director and supervisor of students instead of the lecturer; students become active and autonomous learners instead of passive receivers. Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.},

  abstract={By thinking of a society as a cognitive system, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for artificial social intelligence. This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics the job outlook for computer scientists and engineers is stellar for the long term-President Obama and industry leaders encouraged colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year. Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.},

  abstract={Memory and storage are important elements in consumer electronic devices. They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing. Let's take a look at developments that bring processing and memory/storage together in new ways to enable smarter consumer devices.},

  abstract={A description is given of a systolic Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm for Boolean n-cubes with a substantial amount of storage per cube node. In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>},

  abstract={Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.},

In previous papers we introduced the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach to get more effective and reliable cognitive, biophysical, and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={132965-132975},
  abstract={Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.},

And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved.},

  abstract={This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.},

Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

  abstract={Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-In-Progress paper elucidates the approach of the NSF-funded CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance for creating change in students' competencies by an effort across eight institutions to support the delivery of one-and two-credit hour courses for three levels of problem solving in Computer Science: general problem solving, computational thinking in problem solving, and algorithmic thinking in problem solving. The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.},

  abstract={Many of us write code regularly as part of our scientific activity, perhaps even as a full-time job. But even though we write--and use--more and more code, we rarely think about the roles that this code will have in our research, in our publications, and ultimately in the scientific record. In this article, the author outlines some frequent roles of code in computational science. These roles aren't exclusive; in fact, it's common for a piece of code to have several roles, at the same time or as an evolution over time. Thinking about these roles, ideally before starting to write the code, is a good habit to develop.},

  abstract={Knowledge based methodology is one of the primary areas of development in engineering problem solving methods for decades. In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded. Following this, process for the definition of coordinated product behaviors and affect propagation in a specific and purposeful change affect zone are explained. Finally, an extended product definition space is explained as medium in integrated product modeling using the proposed method.},

  abstract={At present, the lack of emotion is very serious in E-Learning. The most learning platforms can't imitate teaching behavior of the real teacher, and can't provide the emotional communication between teachers and students, so students are easy to lose learning interest. In 3D virtual learning environment based on virtual reality, a 3D virtual teacher can imitate the figure, action, facial expression and teaching behavior of the real teacher, which enrich emotional experience, arouse learning interest and promote creative thinking of students. The modeling technology of 3D virtual teacher is discussed in this paper.},
