  pages={593-608},
  abstract={This paper presents a model metrics and a methodology for evaluating the critical path on the data flow execution graph (DFEG) of multimedia algorithms specified as C programs. The paper describes an efficient dynamic critical path evaluation approach that generates no explicit execution graph. Such approach includes two key stages: 1) the instrumentation of the C code and the mapping into a C++ code version and 2) the execution of the C++ code under real input data and finally the actual dynamic evaluation of the critical path. The model metrics and the software analysis methodologies aim at the estimation and at the increase of the upper bound of execution speed and parallelization potential. Both metrics and methodology are particularly tailored for application with complex multimedia algorithms. Critical path analysis and the subsequent algorithmic development stage is a fundamental methodological preliminary step for the efficient definition of architectures when the objective is the implementation of the multimedia algorithm on systems-on-chips or heterogeneous platforms.},

  abstract={In this paper, we report our first experiment in teaching the theory of computability in the problem-based way. As far as we know, this is the first experiment of applying the problem-based method to a purely theoretical course of computer science. Performing the course consisted of three parts: First, the new subjects were learnt according to the classical seven step method, which contains both individual and group work, and problem reports were written. Second, the students participated in a traditional exercise session, in which the new techniques were practised in details. And third, the students kept a learning diary, in which they processed the subjects further, tried to construct an overall schema of things learnt, and supervised their own learning. The results were really successful: the students committed themselves well and the drop out percentage was very small; they achieved very deep understanding of the subjects measured by their grades and quality of learning diaries; the experience was enjoyable for both the students and the teachers; and finally, the method supported different kinds of learners very well.},

  pages={793-798},
  abstract={To exploit the benefits of throughput-optimized processors such as GPUs, applications need to be redesigned to achieve performance and efficiency. In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel. Another contribution of the paper is a critical graph analysis technique to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo based SSTA, leading to 2-9X further speedup.},

  abstract={Power system state estimation (SE) plays a crucial role in the success of advanced tools employed for power system analysis and control in Energy Management Systems. SE is responsible for providing a consistent real-time dataset, free from errors that may compromise decision-making and put the system at risk. The presence of criticalities involving elements such as network branches, measuring units or measurements may impose difficulties for the detection/identification of gross errors in the acquired data. The simultaneous unavailability of the elements that form a given criticality makes the grid unobservable. This paper presents a flexible and effective network-based methodology for the integrated identification of critical groups of branches, measurements and measuring units in SE. The proposed algorithms are constructed, having the properties of such criticalities as their central pillar. Tests performed with IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus benchmark systems are presented, and the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={Can computers overcome human capabilities? This is a paradoxical and controversial question, particularly because there are many hidden assumptions. This article focuses on that issue putting on evidence some misconception related to future generations of machines and the understanding of the brain. It will discuss to what extent computers might reach human capabilities, and how it would be possible only if the computer is a conscious machine. However, it will be shown that if the computer is conscious, an interference process due to consciousness would affect the information processing of the system. Therefore, it might be possible to make conscious machines to overcome human capabilities, which will have similar limitations than humans. In other words, trying to overcome human capabilities with computers implies the paradoxical conclusion that a computer will never overcome human capabilities at all, or if the computer does, it should not be considered as a computer anymore.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1780-1785},
  abstract={This paper reports on a pilot study of using ChatGPT, a language model based on GPT-3.5 architecture, for automatic generation of metamorphic relations (MRs), in the context of testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications and limitations of using ChatGPT for MR generation and provide recommendations for future research. Our study contributes to the advancement of automated testing of ADSs, which is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={The interplay between pairs of critical factors such as performance, energy and reliability within modern computing systems has always been an interesting topic of study. However, studying the interplay of all three factors together in a many-core, multi-layer design setting has been a relatively recent undertaking. This work explores the practical problems encountered in such studies and introduces the modelling framework ArchOn, which is based on a novel resource-driven graph representation. ArchOn facilitates the analysis and potentially design and synthesis of systems whose design domains are more conveniently organized into multiple layers or levels (e.g. application, OS, hardware, etc.) and potentially large scale and diverse types of concurrency. The layer-agnostic formalism helps designers reason about cross-layer issues and the resource-driven approach is advantageous for reasoning about such issues as energy and time. Example single- and multi-core case studies help explain and illustrate the method.},

  abstract={The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The impact of process variations increases as technology scales to nanometer region. Under large process variations, the path and arc/node criticality provide effective metrics in guiding circuit optimization. To facilitate the criticality computation considering the correlation, the authors define the critical region for the path and arc/node in a timing graph, and propose an efficient method to compute the criticality for paths and arcs/nodes simultaneously by a single breadth-first graph traversal during the backward propagation. Instead of choosing a set of paths for analysis prematurely, we develop a new property of the path criticality to prune those paths with low criticality at very earlier stages, so that our path criticality computation method has linear complexity with respect of the timing edges in a timing graph. To improve the computation accuracy, cutset and path criticality properties are exploited to calibrate the computation results. The experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that our criticality computation method can achieve high accuracy with fast speed},

  abstract={Edge Intelligence (EI) based collaborative learning approaches have been researched in the recent years by several researchers. As majority of existing collaborative learning approaches are designed in the context of servers, design and development of novel systems are required in order to apply collaborative learning in resource constrained devices. Researchers possess different interpretations of the existing collaborative learning approaches. This paper presents an analysis of the existing work conducted on collaborative learning approaches on the domain of EI. The strongholds and drawbacks of the existing work will be analyzed to identify an ideal collaborative learning approach to be applied on the Internet of things (IoT) edge. The analysis will further include an investigation into the future enhancements and research gaps. The partitioned model training approach has been identified as the most ideal approach for the IoT edge based on the conducted critical analysis process. The reduction of communication overhead in the partitioned model training approach and the application of the partitioned model training approach in other unexplored deep learning model architectures have been identified as future research directions. This paper is a work in progress section of an ongoing research and in the future the findings will be used to design a system to apply the collaborative learning approach in IoT Edge and bridge the existing research gaps.},

  abstract={The present utilization of engineers and scientists by industry and its significance to the ``shortage'' of scientific manpower has been investigated. Based upon available data, a limited-sample survey of scientific manpower in the aviation and electronic industries, and analyses, a rough estimate indicates that the probable average effectiveness of these scientists is somewhat less than ten per cent of perfect utilization. Various methods of increasing scientific productivity are examined. An operations research study is suggested. Improvements of communications, management techniques, and data processing methods are several recommendations. A brief history of scientific manpower supply and demand is presented. Motivations of scientists are studied, as are motivations which lead students into science careers. Estimates are made of the future supply of and demand for scientific manpower, assuming present utilization. These figures indicate the shortage will become a surplus by 1971.},

  title={On the Applicability of Speaker Diarization to Audio Concept Detection for Multimedia Retrieval}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},

  pages={446-451},
  abstract={Recently, audio concepts emerged as a useful building block in multimodal video retrieval systems. Information like "this file contains laughter", "this file contains engine sounds" or "this file contains slow music" can significantly improve purely visual based retrieval. The weak point of current approaches to audio concept detection is that they heavily rely on human annotators. In most approaches, audio material is manually inspected to identify relevant concepts. Then instances that contain examples of relevant concepts are selected -- again manually -- and used to train concept detectors. This approach comes with two major disadvantages: (1) it leads to rather abstract audio concepts that hardly cover the audio domain at hand and (2) the way human annotators identify audio concepts likely differs from the way a computer algorithm clusters audio data -- introducing additional noise in training data. This paper explores whether unsupervized audio segementation systems can be used to identify useful audio concepts by analyzing training data automatically and whether these audio concepts can be used for multimedia document classification and retrieval. A modified version of the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) speaker diarization system finds segments in an audio track that have similar perceptual properties and groups these segments. This article provides an in-depth analysis on the statistic properties of similar acoustic segments identified by the diarization system in a predefined document set and the theoretical fitness of this approach to discern one document class from another.},

Class-membership is itself construed as a class in the network of classes; more specifically, it is construed by the intersection of 'intensive' and 'ascriptive' in the system network. In conclusion, I identify one of the ways my discussion has been restricted: I have focused an language as a resource for construing experience since the point of departure was Zadeh's remarks about human thought. 'Construing experience' is one of the three generalized functions of language the ideational function. The other two are the interpersonal and textual functions, and both of these are also inherently fuzzy.<>},

  abstract={This paper describes the use of different and complementary teaching tools on two consecutive courses on Soil Mechanics (on an integrated master in Civil Engineering). In these courses, project-based learning with collaborative or cooperative teamwork was implemented. The teaching tools adopted and described herein include text processors, spreadsheets and presentations, as well as specialized geotechnical software. The students' perceptions were collected using a questionnaire and the impact of those different tools on the students' perceptions are analysed. Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes. Getting students on board, by discussing the aims of using specific strategies, is key to promote academic success. Therefore, students must be the centre of all the teaching and learning processes.},

  abstract={This article reinterprets algorithmic rationality by looking at the interaction between mathematical logic, mechanized reasoning, and, later, computing in the Russian Imperial and Soviet contexts to offer a history of the algorithm as a mathematical object bridging the inner and outer worlds, a humanistic vision that we, following logician Vladimir Uspensky, call the “culture of the impossible.” We unfold the deep roots of this vision as embodied in scientific intelligentsia. In Part I, we examine continuities between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century discussions of poznaniye—an epistemic orientation towards the process of knowledge acquisition—and the postwar rise of the Soviet school of mathematical logic. Establishing this connection allows us to explain, in Part II, the role of the algorithm in disciplinary dynamics between mathematical logic and cybernetics and a characteristic understanding of programming, not as a narrow skill, but as a matter of consciousness.},

  abstract={We are currently living in an economy driven by data as a form of capital and by increasingly diverse, emerging data accumulation methods. Based on a case study of Innovation Labs, a tech accelerator implemented in Romania since 2013, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship competences that are sensitive to the potential and limitations of big data. Data capitalism has significant implications not only in our everyday life and business, but also on the instruments that we employ to understand the world and to achieve value. The data-based society needs complex information technology to process information, to observe, to map, to extract, to put together streams of data which eventually are leading to decision making and to value creation, including - but not limited to - financial value. Big data applications gather data from heterogeneous activity fields and seek to create insights through their cross-sectional interpretation. How are young tech-oriented people equipped to navigate the data-storm that this global current of digitalization and automation is creating? We will look at the case of Innovation Labs tech accelerator, by analyzing the last four editions of the program in terms of working with (big) data.},

  abstract={Cognitive Science is a complex mechanism of solving a problem based on the impact of behavior, analysis of interpretation, studying mental representations functioning of the neurons at the level of brain, perceiving and sensing an object: a living: nature & nurture, a deeper understanding of psychological aspects, relating mind to the brain, handling emotional sense with Intelligent quotient, a meta-analysis study of automation, handling the issues dealing with biasedness due to lack of optimal Hypothesis, correlating to develop ontological representations and illustrating the language of thought on empirical evidence, observational phenomena and applying technologies of Deep learning, machine learning, statistics subset to Artificial Intelligence for optimality. This comprehensive literature study navigates through the historical evolution and interdisciplinary dimensions of cognitive science, spanning from ancient Greek philosophy to its contemporary amalgamation with neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Examining theoretical paradigms like formal logic, rules, concepts, analogies, images, and connectionism, the study elucidates their pivotal roles in deciphering the mind's intricate representations and computations. Focused on the challenges encountered by cognitive science, the study underscores the integration of analytics, foundational concepts, and diverse methodologies such as statistical tools, machine learning, and prescriptive analytics. A Structured outlined working procedure showcases the application of cognitive science principles to enhance student performance, conducting and evaluating surveys, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and association rule mining. The methodology progresses systematically from data collection and persona analysis to prediction hypothesis formulation, mismatch analysis, marks prediction, rule-based classification, association rule mining, data analytics, and exploratory data analysis. Signifying the importance of big data, the study recommends cognitive computing concepts for intervention measures, encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy, gaming approaches, and neurological interventions, thereby contributing to the practical implementation of cognitive science in student performance analysis and intervention.},

  abstract={Maker education for entrepreneurship and innovation is an important mission of China universities. However, current maker education in China universities has the limitations of closed innovation, efficiency-driven, focal product, specialized organization, and so on. This failed to meet makers' demands for real-time awareness of space, adaptive automatic resources, diverse innovation activities and tools with intelligent support in makerspace. Therefore, the innovation ecosystem has emerged to be the best choice to solve those problems. This paper first analyses fundamental principles and elements of innovation ecosystem, and then discusses essentials and properties of innovation ecosystem-oriented maker(IEOM) education. After that, the model of IEOM education by smart technologies is developed, including innovation subject, innovation activity, and innovation environment. Innovative subjects include experiencers, innovators, researchers and experts. Innovation activities are created by the innovation subjects including interest, research, practice and smart creation. The innovation environment is a creation scenario reflecting innovative subjects' rich creation in participating in innovation activities.},

  abstract={The call for empowering women to participate fully in all sectors of society posits that women's participation is key to economic growth, political stability, and social transformation. Approaches to achieve such participation, however, are trivialized due to existing gender biases and women continue to lag behind in STEM professions. In this article I argue for the transformative power of an interdisciplinary mindset - particularly one engendered by a STEAM education whereby `A' stands for Arts-as a catalyst for STEM careers and beyond. Furthermore, I conclude that STEAM will prevail in the hands of interdisciplinary leaders.},
