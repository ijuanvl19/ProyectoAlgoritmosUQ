  abstract={In this paper I presented an algorithm which could be used as a controller technique for access systems in highly-secured environments. Highly-secured environments like critical infrastructures have to count less significant but more effective risks, which may lead to a fatal effect in the society. More stringent regulations involve more reliable access systems, which use mostly multimodal biometrical identification. Soft-computing techniques, especially fuzzy logic is suitable as a controller algorithm in a multimodal biometrical identification system. To highlight the advantages of this method, I modeled a comparison between the statistical mean value calculation and the fuzzy logic adapted controller.},

The results provide a clear ranking of features based on their overall total score, enabling product teams to make data-driven decisions on which features to prioritize in the development lifecycle. The framework balances user needs with business goals, ensuring that the chosen features deliver maximum value while maintaining technical feasibility.

  pages={1-3},
  abstract={Permeability is a crucial factor in oil and gas exploration and development, as it indicates a reservoir's ability to flow. To predict permeability from electrical exploration results, Critical Path Analysis (CPA) is commonly used by combining reservoir permeability and electrical conductivity. However, the accuracy of CPA decreases when unconventional reservoirs exhibit strong anisotropy, such as fractured shales. This study presents tensor-based CPA methods that utilize equivalent electrical parameters and permeability tensor to address this issue. The approach involves obtaining critical pore radius and permeability in tensor form through matrix operation. The accuracy of the CPA formula in calculating reservoir permeability is then compared with numerical simulation results. The findings indicate that the tensor-based CPA method significantly improves the permeability prediction accuracy of anisotropic media, and further improvements can be made using the revised tensor-based CPA.},

  abstract={21st-century interactions involve the consumption of content, whether in the form of text, audio, images, or any other medium. This paper presents a multimodal content generation (MCG) system that seeks to ease the content production process by providing integrated solutions for video, image, audio and text content production among others. Large language models (LLMs) have shown a great promise in enhancing the creativity process in various fields such as media and education where mediums of communication interweave. The system takes into account the current data, situation, user needs, and composes an appropriate and suitable content for them. At the same time, conventional AI models, such as transformers, are combined with multimodal models enhanced with optimization strategies such as transfer learning and fine-tuning. This strategy greatly augments the content generation potential and scalability of the system and thus, is of great importance in the design of systems for the content production process. The quantum- inspired elements of the hybrid model are the ones targeted towards making changes in decision and feature selection within the creative processes. The effectiveness of MCG in this research was compared to other content creation systems, and the results of the research revealed that MCG is more creative, efficient, and satisfying for the users than the existing systems; therefore, it has a great potential for changing the practices of producing content in a multimedia environment.},

  title={Semantic Segmentation for Visually Adverse Images – A Critical Review}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={28-33},
  abstract={Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-end visual tasks that has remained a topic of interest in various domains. Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images. Finally, the problems and challenges to be tackled are concluded which highlight the future direction of analysis.},

  abstract={Crime prevention in smart city infrastructure significantly impacts improving quality of human life. However, the substantial increase in the urban population in recent years affects accuracy, safety, and security. This paper presents a solution using the Hyperplane to improve the Radial Basis Function with Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on Machine Learning techniques to enhance accuracy, safety, and security. The SVM method aims to reduce crime rates through proactive measures based on predictive insights. The RBF kernel handles nonlinear relationships by mapping input features into a higher-dimensional space, allowing the model to capture complex patterns. Initially, data is obtained from the Chicago crime dataset and pre-processed by checking for missing values and performing feature scaling to ensure consistency. Feature selection is conducted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify relevant features from the data. Crime prediction using RBF with SVM is performed efficiently to enhance accuracy. The proposed RBF-SVM model is evaluated using the Chicago crime dataset, achieving a high accuracy of 0.89, a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.82, and an F1-score of 0.85. The performance is compared to existing techniques such as Decision Tree (DT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).},

The factors were then used to estimate the factor scores of all other statements through multiple regression analysis and to select the most appropriate respondents. The factors, however, have been obtained without taking into consideration the categories of the Q&A statements. In this paper we therefore investigated whether the consideration of categories could lead to obtaining more apparent tendencies and precise results to select the most appropriate respondents. In this paper, factor analysis is applied to the experimental results with a consideration of the following categories: Auction, PC, Love, and Politics. As a result of factor analysis, both similarity and difference could be observed for each category of Q&A statements. Comparing the new results with the previous one, two similar main factors could be obtained regardless of the category considered. On the other hand, factors other than the two have were also obtained for each respective category. This shows that the number of factors obtained for each category varies.},

  abstract={Deep learning models have shown amazing success in picture categorization chores thanks to the fast developments in computer vision. Of them, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a potent instrument for precisely identifying landmarks and objects. This work employs an upgraded ResNet50 architecture, ResNet50V2, to classify famous sites from all around the world. Twelve different sites total—Burj Khalifa, Chichen Itza, Christ the Redeemer, Eiffel Tower, Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu, Pyramids of Giza, Roman Colosseum, Statue of Liberty, Stonehenge, Taj Mahal, and Venezuela's Angel Falls. Renowned for their architectural and cultural value, these sites create a difficult classification challenge given their different structures, histories, and locations. For uses in tourism, cultural preservation, and instructional materials, accurate visual classification of these sites has great promise. ResNet50V2's deep residual learning architecture allows it to learn and generalize features from challenging datasets, so appropriate for this work. This work intends to assess ResNet50V2's effectiveness in differentiating these internationally known landmarks, therefore supporting the larger domains of picture classification and landmark identification. Furthermore, in line with world sustainability objectives, this study supports efforts toward sustainable cultural heritage management, promotes education, tourism, and digital preservation by precisely identifying and classifying these locations.},

The bottom-up approach has been proved as more effective in process improvement applied to technical and scientific environments, in oppocition to standard improvement models such as ISO or CMMI. However, when bottom-up is applied to elicit improvement areas, the method is usually limited to the use of surveys that miss many of the root causes and structural deficiencies. To complement the elicitation process, we propose the use of requirement-gathering techniques such as Card Sorting, Kelly Grid and Multi-Voting. Initial results are discussed in this paper.},
