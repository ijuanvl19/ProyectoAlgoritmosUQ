  abstract={Common cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke are the major cause of mortality and disability in recent decades. Increased blood viscosity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Elevated blood viscosity is associated with atherosclerosis and its growth. The knowledge of the arterial hemodynamics resulted due to atherosclerosis with different level of blood viscosity can clarify the relationship between artery stenosis and symptoms, and, finally, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Hence proficient imaging of blood flow has great clinical importance to understand the origin and evolution of disease. Therefore, investigation and detection of viscosity change and its effect might be helpful for better diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. In this simulation work, hemo-disturbances are studied in a carotid artery finite element model (FEM) with atherosclerosis under different viscosities consideration using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The obtained FEM data are used to reconstruct color flow image of blood velocities using ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals to study atherosclerosis detecting the viscosity changes. The findings of this study suggest that ultrasound based blood flow image can detect the viscosity change effect related to atherosclerosis growth. We think the findings will be helpful to develop effective ultrasound imaging technique for atherosclerosis diagnosis.},

  abstract={Schools are increasingly integrating character education to facilitate improved moral thinking and pro social behavior among students. An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes. However, schools are rarely able to use animated vignettes since existing tools do not allow them to be easily created and having them created externally is overly expensive. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool’s multimedia features are often used and well-liked. Educators can download and use our tool while researchers can draw upon our design rationale and lessons learned when building similar tools.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neuro-development behavioural disorder that is classified as a chronic disability leaving individuals unable to accurately grasp their environment and can lead to limited development of communication skills, thinking and other social skills. Prediction of ASD using video recordings is an open-ended critical problem in machine learning to facilitate the process of early intervention which requires high computational resources. This research aims to predict ASD in children using videos by extracting features and converting them into a binary classification problem thereby eliminating the need for high computational resources. This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively. In this article, we offer an overview of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder whilst focusing on the importance of video datasets.},

  abstract={The aim of this article is to investigate the role of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and foresight techniques in supporting strategic foresight to reduce uncertainty in the field of Futures Studies. The combination of these approaches helps to better understand the future alternatives available to decision-makers by combining storytelling with trend extrapolation using a proposed new hybrid process called FLighTS (Future Lighthouse Trending Scenarios). Thus, in the process of determining the most appropriate future, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to vague and ambiguous value judgments in the process of inference of decision makers.The work presented in this article aims to improve the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to facilitate further exploration of the possibilities of a new non-linear way of thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental example that develops a case for a higher education institution (HEI).The article ends with a reflection on conceptual modeling and suggests ways for use in future research.},

  pages={85-90},
  abstract={Accurate recognition of the meaning of words in the given document fragments has a long historical standing in computational linguistics. Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms.},

  abstract={The creation of navigable, geographic art and its interactions is a novel, ideal environment for a computationally creative system. In this paper, we present a system that utilizes a canvas of city blocks to draw paths that represent the mood of the user, or if none is provided, it picks inspiration for itself. By being provided with user mood input, the system then identifies images that represent the provided emotion and, on its own volition, plots a path for the user to traverse. This kind of art is often classified as Strava Art which has been a hobby within online groups as early as 2015. The presented system utilizes techniques for translation and navigation of geodetic data provided by OpenStreetMap, processing images in the knowledge base for geographic display, and error checking through the use of Hausdorff calculations. Through a publicly administered survey, it was demonstrated that the system is effective at generating artifacts that are representative of the selected image.

  abstract={Poetry generation is a branch of text generation that demands a high level of linguistic proficiency and creativity. The Urdu language, renowned for its rich poetic tradition, encompasses a diverse collection of poets, each possessing a unique writing style. This research explores the automatic generation of Urdu poetry, specifically Urdu ghazals which hold a significant cultural value using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including deep learning. The dataset used consists of 17,609 couplets from the works of 15 renowned Urdu ghazal poets. We use three different approaches for poetry generation which include (a) the n-gram probabilistic model, (b) deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU, and (c) the state-of-the-art GPT-2 model. BLEU scores for each of these were (a) 0.5 for the n-gram model, (b) 0.1 for LSTM and GRU and, (c) 0.6 for the GPT-2 model, which was the highest overall score. In addition to the BLEU score, other metrics such as rhyming score and human evaluation were considered for evaluating the generated poetry. This research is the first to use transformer-based models for Urdu poetry generation, which enables aspiring poets to learn from and be inspired by the rich tradition of Urdu poetry.},

By comparing model- and human-generated measures of the similarity between pairs of faces, we were able to assess the accord between several automatic face recognition algorithms and human perceivers. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to create a spatial representation of the subject response patterns. Next, the model response patterns were projected into this space. The results revealed a common bimodal structure for both the subjects and for most of the models. The bimodal subject structure reflected strategy differences in making similarity decisions. For the models, the bimodal structure was related to combined aspects of the representations and the distance metrics used in the implementations.},

  abstract={Model-based diagnosis has the disadvantage of a high computational complexity. One way to overcome this disadvantage is to focus the diagnosis on a reduced diagnostic space. We propose an improved critical diagnosis reasoning method based on the method proposed by (Raiman et al., 1993). The method focuses the diagnosis on finding out the kernel diagnoses instead of the whole diagnoses. We give an updated definition of critical cover which we call "critical partition". The conditions satisfied by critical partition are relaxed compared with the conditions for critical cover. Correspondingly, a non-backtracking algorithm called Searching Critical Partition (SCP) to find out the critical partition is also proposed.},

We encourage engineers of mission-critical systems to look for then cavemen (or squirrels) and to study carefully what actions these adversaries might take against the products they roll out. In this paper we examine simple attacks on routing protocols for wireless networks.

  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={During 2016-19, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded the “Connect Everything: Industrial Systems in the Digital Age” programme (£ 1m) and adopted the German-initiated term “Industry 4.0” for the coming a priori “industrial revolution”. As part of this programme, University of Glasgow hosted the EPSRC’s first conference on this topic - “Looking Beyond Industry 4.0”. The success of this programme led to another round of £ 1m funding for “Connected Everything II: Accelerating Digital Manufacturing Research Collaboration and Innovation” (2019-22), so as “to make the most of this fourth industrial revolution”. The first three Industrial Revolutions took place a posteriori, and mostly, were concerned with assisting and liberating humans from physical labour. Today, should the a priori Industry 4.0 differ from the previous industrial revolutions? If so, would the difference be in a focus on assisting and liberating humans from mental labour for the first time? The recent World Economic Forum highlighted four main design principles of this revolution: (1) Interoperability, (2) Information transparency, (3) Cognitive and physical assistance (4) Decentralised decisions and actions. Coinciding with this wave of revolution is the third wave of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently in its earnest resurgence. It is now possible to develop computational AI technology to surpass a human designer in innovation and creativity, just like AlphaGo Zero in London to have surpassed AlphaGo and humans in Go playing. The progress of science and technology now heavily relies on simulation-based ‘third paradigm of science’ in the form of ‘computer-aided design’ (CAD). AI can transform CAD simulations to predictive simulations for ‘computer-automated design’ (CAutoD), which becomes possible through AI with the increased computing power and data. Thus, CAutoD should help Industry 4.0 to achieve mass customisation at a mass production cost in the near future. However, design, manufacturing and service all need to be taken into account for factory-floor innovation in order to deliver transformative improvements in performance, productivity and time-to-market. Commensurate with the ‘intelligent manufacturing’ value chain and ‘market informatics’ at the end of this value chain, such Industry 4.0 would enhance innovation, creativity and competitiveness.},

  abstract={Hybrid state estimation determines the states of systems monitored both by conventional SCADA measurements and PMUs. This paper proposes a decentralization method in order to improve the computational performance of hybrid state estimators with minimum loss of accuracy. The proposed method utilizes sensitivity matrix that relates measurement errors to state estimates in order to form the so-called isolated bus groups and observable subislands. Although the proposed decentralization method can be applied to any state estimator, the paper is developed using a least absolute value (LAV) estimator for demonstration purposes, which is known to be robust against bad data. The high computational burden of LAV estimator compared to the well-known weighted least squares estimator is eliminated, thanks to the proposed decentralization method.},

  abstract={This paper explores impediments to innovation in aerospace and suggests how successful pathways from other industries can be adopted to facilitate greater innovation. Because of its nature, space exploration would seem to be a ripe field of technical innovation. However, engineering can also be a frustratingly conservative endeavor when the realities of cost and risk are included. Impediments like the ¿find the fault¿ engineering culture, the treatment of technical risk as almost always evaluated in terms of negative impact, the difficult to account for expansive Moore's Law growth when making predictions, and the stove-piped structural organization of most large aerospace companies and federally funded research laboratories tend to inhibit cross-cutting technical innovation. One successful example of a multi-use cross cutting application that can scale with Moore's Law is the Evolutionary Computational Methods (ECM) technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Lab for automated spectral retrieval. Future innovations like computational engineering and automated design optimization can potentially redefine space exploration, but will require learning lessons from successful innovators.},

  abstract={This paper describes a computational infrastructure used to support creative design in detecting emergent shapes in the specific context of shape grammar implementation. Shape grammars have been used to represent the knowledge behind the creative work of architects, designers and artists. This kind of grammars are inherently visual and they allow the implementation of computational mechanisms to either synthesize or analyze designs of visual languages, including the detection of emergent sub-shapes languages. They have obvious applications to design, including for marketing. The infrastructure presented, together with the algorithm to which it gives support, the latter proposed in another, twin, paper, is a core component of a system, described in our past work, that allows users to build their own shape grammars and experiment with and use them.},

  abstract={While most contemporary researchers argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides overwhelming and profound advancements in technology and beneficial tools used daily to advance human life on earth, there exist a host of other researchers who hold contrary opinions to this view, with regard to the rising adverse ontological and existential consequences which the products of super-intelligent technologies has on an alarming number of mankind in the 21st century. Scholars like Vardi, Tegmark and Greene likened this scenario to a time-bomb waiting to go off any moment. The recent endorsement of 23 AI principles by 1200 AI/Robotics researchers and over 2342 other researchers from diverse disciplines, in a just concluded Future of Life (FLI) Conference, adds credence to the worries which most researchers have about the presumed benefits of AI to mankind. The study draws from a combination of Marxian Alienation and ontological theories which basically holds that: rising advancements in AI technologies, continues to alienate mankind from his existential human nature. The ex-post facto research design in the social sciences and Deriders' deconstructive and critical reconstructive analytic method in philosophy, for interrogating the meaning of concepts, arguments and current debates on the relevance and risks of IA, were adopted for the study. The study identified justifiable grounds and reasons for the alarm raised over current innovations in the field of AI technologies. The study strengthen the resolve of current researchers to identify ways of reducing or avoiding the impending adverse consequences of evolving conscious AI and machines in the feature. The research proposes a radical legal enforcement and adoption of the 23 newly established AI principles as one of the pertinent measure for saving mankind from the impending threats posed by innovations powered by advances in AI technology.},
