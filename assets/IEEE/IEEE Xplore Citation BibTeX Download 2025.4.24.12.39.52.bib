  abstract={This paper aims to highlight the conceptual model of MESE (Multimedia in Education for Special Education). MESE for mental retardation children is based on whole language theory, pedagogical approaches, and multisensory concept which are suitable for learning and teaching reading. The design and development approaches of MESE has been designed to improve reading through a curriculum and instructional design, content, communication, computer capacity, creativity, compatibility, and interface. This program is designed to provide a teaching and learning module in the vernacular language, suitable for individualized and self paced learning. It is hoped that this prototype for improving reading will be beneficial to beginners as well as emergent and reluctant readers alike and serves as a framework for future MESE development. Results of the experiment showed that MESE is effective in improving reading of mental retardation children.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of modern information technology, English learning methods and approaches are gradually diversified, especially the English electronic dictionary, which makes English learning easier. The quality of translation is an important criterion to measure the results of English interpret, which is mainly characterized by errors in translation characters or spelling, inconsistent expression, lexical and grammatical errors, etc. At present, the most advanced machine translation method, the so-called phrase-based model, is only limited to the mapping of small text blocks. Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation. Based on modern intelligent identification technology, this paper studies the development of English intelligent proofreading system, grasps the user's behavior data through behavior log, and optimizes the system. The software part of the system PP. adopts the computer intelligent proofreading method based on the improved phrase translation model to find the correct words to replace the words to be proofread and realize the intelligent proofreading of English interpret.},

The findings will be part of a methodological framework to evaluate whether or not AI is a high-value digital tool in this context. Approach: The study is designed through a series of workshops with architecture students, which aim to identify the role of image-based AI in the architecture design process for under-graduate students in Sino-foreign higher education institutions in order to assess the potential of using AI in the future architecture industry, especially for junior architects. Findings: The preliminary findings of this ongoing study indicate that AI increases the creativity of architecture design concepts, especially via better visual presentation for junior students. However, AI does not seem to be able to comprehend basic architecture design principles when it is implemented. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study will aid the larger teaching community when adopting AI in their teaching while mitigating the potential negative impacts on the students' learning experiences.},

  abstract={The demand for well-trained nursing professionals is ever-increasing, necessitating efficient placement processes post-graduation. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of balancing model performance with interpretability. Further research and implementation efforts are warranted to refine predictive modeling approaches and seamlessly integrate them into nursing education and workforce management practices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nursing practice and patient care delivery.},

The Hijazi heritage is full of unique art forms, including the Rawashin that adorn Hijazi buildings. With the remarkable technical progress of recent years, it has become necessary to highlight this identity in a contemporary way. This work aims to exploit and explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence techniques and GAN networks in creating and producing innovative new shapes with regard to Rawashin (wooden windows). The aim is to integrate such shapes with Arabic lettering in order to produce unprecedented designs in terms of Hijazi buildings. This is done by training the machine using a dataset consisting of images of different building shapes containing Rawashin and some Arabic calligraphy using two types of GAN models. As a result, the model was able to learn and produce a new style of Rawashin.},

In addition, the model is rendered by VARY Tenderer. Finally, the overall modeling effect is rendered by PS technology. Although this scheme is a widely chosen production process for producers, there are still unreasonable problems, including size, modeling sequence, modeling test and mapping efficiency. The second is the CASD software developed by the Chinese Academy of Architectural Sciences, which has the characteristics of super integration and precision, and is more efficient and practical than the previous production process.
