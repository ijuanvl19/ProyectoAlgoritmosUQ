  abstract={Sensing has become a pivotal element in the development of autonomous systems with the advancement of the technology. These systems operate on a sense-think-act cycle to execute tasks, necessitating the integration of multiple sensors. The challenge of synthesizing meaningful information from diverse data sources escalates with the complexity of the data. This study tackles the issue of sensor data complexity by investigating the potential of Fuzzy Signatures, which are promising in handling complex data due to their hierarchical structures. The main goal is to present a concept for sensor fusion based on Fuzzy Signatures, which may facilitate their use in autonomous system tasks. To demonstrate this concept, accelerometer and gyroscope data are utilized, with results compared to those from a Complementary Filter providing insight into the sensor fusion capabilities of Fuzzy Signatures. The study also underscores the importance of aggregation operators in Fuzzy Signatures, focusing on the Max and WRAO (weighted relevance aggregation operator) aggregation operators. The potential to employ various aggregation operators or to develop new ones for specific applications is highlighted. The findings indicate that Fuzzy Signatures could be an effective solution for sensor fusion challenges, offering prospects for enhancement and broader application in autonomous systems.},

  abstract={Role as new abstraction has been gradually used in agent analysis and design research field, and it is generally defined as an entity or a set of properties. The relationship between role and agent is relative independent, and role model is established before agent model. In this paper, we think role and agent is interdependent, agent is carrier of role, and role means what agent can do. When analysis and design agent model, should firstly have agent entity, then have role. We define role as a set of computation specification and function to realize relationship between two agents, establish a mapping between BDI model and role, and define an agent BDI model based on role (RA) using Pi calculus. Based on theory analysis, RA can keep balance among belief, desire and intention, and maintain model stable. In the end, we give an example of RA, example show RA can be conveniently established and used to construct agent goal solving organization.},

  abstract={Benin’s health system, like all health systems, is faced with the challenge of providing quality, safe and affordable health care. The problems of understaffing of health care personnel compared to the WHO recommendation on the one hand, and the problems of poor distribution of these health care personnel over the extent of the health care system on the other hand, lead us to think about a model of mobility and accessibility of health care in Benin. This work aims at setting up an intelligent algorithm of accessibility and mobility of health care and will allow any patient embarked at any point of the health system to be taken care of automatically by a doctor and a nurse. To achieve this, we have (i) studied the state of the art of healthcare accessibility and mobility, (ii) modeled the healthcare trajectory, (iii) developed an algorithm for the automatic assignment and management of a patient in a healthcare system and simulated it using operations research and graph tools. The work allowed to set up a dynamic algorithm of accessibility to health care and to answer the challenges of the health care systems.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={42-47},
  abstract={Analysis methods are essential for the vessel-impact resistant design of bridge structures, which have respect to reasonably determine the demand and capacity of bridge structures subjected to vessel impact loading. For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.},

  abstract={In recent years, the emergence of cooperative robots has been facilitated by technological advances, including the development of safety devices. Although these robots are considerably more flexible than conventional industrial robots, when confronted with a new task, the human operator is often left to address related problems unaided. The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions. To facilitate this collaboration, this paper presents the development of a manipulator that enables two separate control centers the human brain and the robot's computational system to cooperate in solving complex, cognitive-motor tasks.},

  abstract={The design and engineering of children's artifacts-like engineering in general - exhibits a recurring philosophical tension between what might be called an emphasis on "ease of use" on the one hand, and an emphasis on "user empowerment" on the other. This paper argues for a style of technological toy design that emphasizes construction, mastery, and personal expressiveness for children, and that consequently runs counter to the (arguably ascendant) tradition of toys that work "like magic". We describe a series of working prototypes from our laboratories - examples that illustrate new technologies in the service of children's construction - and we use these examples to ground a wider-ranging discussion of toy design and potential future work.},

  pages={206-211},
  abstract={Suicide is a very critical and important issue in modern society. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for college and high school students. Social media allows students in the digital environment to share their suicidal ideas and thoughts with others. Accurate and early detection and prevention of suicidal ideation in students can save the students' lives. To identify the risk factor for suicidal attempts, a suitable method of analysing the suicidal behaviour of students using their sentiment text posted on social media can be used. This paper presents an optimized Dragonfly algorithm (DFA) using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the automatic detection of suicidal ideation in students. In our CyberHelp Solution, the proposed DFA-based DBN model analyses student social media data, predicts suicidal behavior, and treats students appropriately. The sentiment analysis performs automated categorization of online messages and makes accurate predictions of the student’s suicidal behaviors. The dragonfly heuristic optimization algorithm is used for tuning the hyperparameter in the deep belief network. The proposed DFA-DBN technique has been implemented to predict suicidal ideation in students with a higher accuracy of 95.5% compared with other classification models.},

  abstract={Everyone has a distinct handwriting style, even identical twins who share the same genes. This distinctiveness has allowed researchers to develop systems that can classify the writer's traits, including gender, age, handedness, and others. A gender classification system, for instance, classifies handwriting patterns to predict the writer's gender. With the advancement of deep learning, it is now possible to automatically extract features from the document and classify them. In this paper, two gender classification models based on Alex-Net and LeNet-5 CNN were proposed, trained, and tested on a private Urdu handwriting dataset containing 284,000 pre-segmented characters from 200 males and 200 females. The proposed models achieved state-of- the-art performance compared to existing deep learning models for gender classification. The Alex-Net model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.14%, while the LeNet-5 model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.55%.},

  abstract={Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOD) has emerged as a significant health concern in India, with prevalence rates reported between 9% to 36%. However, societal stigmas and misconceptions hinder the timely recognition and diagnosis of PCOD. A multi-modal AI-based framework for PCOD Detection and Risk Assessment is presented considering algorithms that include SVM, CNN, KNN, Otsu, and Näıve Bayes. This work integrates both image and numerical data utilizing ultrasound images, blood test results, and various patient parameters. 12 key parameters: height, weight, BMI, FSH, TSH, LH, AMH, PRL, Vitamin D3, progesterone, and RBS are considered. We conducted a survey involving 81 participants. Our survey revealed that 45% of participants were unaware of their PCOD status despite exhibiting symptoms, and 73% of participants exhibited symptoms of PCOD. 19.8% of respondents confirmed PCOD diagnoses. Our framework enhances diagnostic precision but also mitigates the emotional toll wrought by PCOD through early intervention and support.},

  abstract={Learning progress is fascinating, especially in STEM fields. When learning novel concepts and principles, the learners will try to link and compare the newly learned contents with their existing knowledge system. If the newly learned knowledge matches the built-up ones, the learners will easily merge it into their long-term (permanent) knowledge structure. When the newly learned knowledge does not match their existing structure, the learners feel confused and hard to accept and digest. In many cases, the learners learned similar concepts and principles from middle school to post-college at different levels, in mathematics and engineering mechanics. Learners might notice that some of the concepts and principles at different levels looked similar and plausible, but the critical differences didn't catch enough attention, neither the concepts themselves nor the application conditions. Even though the students heard the explanation from the instructors in the class, it does not match their existing daily life experience, which makes it harder to accept and merge it into their knowledge system. In other words, a puzzle piece was put in the blank position where it does not fit. The present study is working on rebuilding the STEM knowledge structures and exploring the differences that existed among high school students (9th- 12th graders), first-year engineering undergraduates, higher-level engineering students, and professional engineers with designed quantitative and qualitative research methods. This research aims to explore the possibility of making the transition smoother from one learning stage to another and develop a novel curriculum that could merge the knowledge structures in a new way to reduce or eliminate the gaps between different levels of STEM learning. The author of the present project was working with 9th-12th grade students from local high schools, and college students in STEM majors at a public university, to rebuild and figure out the differences in their knowledge structures for STEM learning. The project includes preparation work as the development of concept inventories in STEM fields, structured survey questionnaires for both experimental groups. The topics the author chose are concepts shared and inherited from high school STEM education, such as force, velocity, acceleration, Newton's Second Law, etc. Currently, the study focused on the feedback of their scores completing the concept inventories, while the next phase of intervention will be applied.},

  abstract={Although the research on AI-assisted learning rapidly accelerates, there is still a notable gap in investigation into AI-generated content (AIGC) tool use in interdisciplinary academic writing. The present study addresses this gap by investigating the preference of AIGC use by science master’s students in writing interdisciplinary research proposals, and relationship between the use of AIGC tools and their writing abilities was assessed. Through a mixed-methods approach, we collected two iterations of research proposals from 33 students across diverse disciplines, along with their reflections on ChatGPT use. Faculty from both substantiation-track and teaching-track backgrounds were invited to evaluate the proposals and provide individual feedback. Quantitative topic modeling was used to identify theme patterns and areas where AI feedback contributed to improvements.The results showed a strong correlation between AIGC tool usage and higher writing scores, with students reporting that AI significantly enhanced the clarity, coherence, and technical accuracy of their proposals. However, findings also underscore that AI tools are less capable of handling deeper reasoning of niche and the methodological development required for writing in interdisciplinary contexts. Therefore, a balanced approach is necessary, where AI assists in technical aspects and human guidance focuses on advanced reasoning and structuring ideas.},

  abstract={Individual differences in personality determine our preferences, traits and values, which should similarly hold for the way we express ourselves. With current advancements and transformations of technology and society, text-based communication has become ordinary and often even surpasses natural voice conversations- with distinct challenges and opportunities. In this exploratory work, we investigate the impact of personality on the tendency how players of a team-based collaborative alternate reality game express themselves affectively. We collected chat logs from eleven players over two weeks, labeled them according to their affective state, and assessed the connection between them and the five-factor personality domains and facets. After applying multi-linear regression, we found a series of reasonable correlations between (combinations of) personality variables and expressed affect-as increased confusion could be predicted by lower self-competence (C1), personal annoyance by vulnerability to stress (N6) and expressing anger occured more often in players that are prone to anxiety (N1), less humble and modest (A5), think less carefully before they act (C6) and have higher neuroticism (N). Expanding the data set, sample size and input modalities in subsequent work, we aim to confirm these findings and reveal even more interesting connections that could inform affective computing and games user research equally.},

Designer style is modeled via choice-based interactive evolution which adapts the impact of different dimensions of quality based on the designer's choice of certain suggestions over others. Modeling process is carried out similarly to style, but adapting to the current focus of the designer's actions. Goals are modeled by estimating the visual patterns of the designer's final artifact and changing the parameters of the algorithm to enforce such patterns on generated suggestions.},

  abstract={Fuzzy logic is a way of many-valued computing logic that deals with the truth values of the variables between 0 and 1, unlike the conventional Boolean logic. Membership functions are used to depict the fuzzy values of given variable. Though membership functions are determined through expert's opinion, however, the one estimated through heuristic algorithms is the preferable methods. Membership functions determined through statistical and knowledge engineering methods are usually application dependent and cannot be applied on different datasets. This research focuses on generating the parametric values of the triangular membership function using a novel method. Initially, the Fuzzy C-means algorithm is utilized to generate the parameters values of the Gaussian membership function. Using a set of equations, these values then estimate the parameters of the triangular membership function. The proposed method is applied to the quality of web services data. From the results it is verified that the new approach of generating triangular membership functions can be adopted.},

  abstract={Sustaining open innovation requires better understanding how collaborative efforts of contributors yield collective creativity. One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of collective creativity involves how collectives govern and coordinate the actions of individuals to maximize innovation output. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in open innovation communities. To this end, we examine the impact of governance mechanisms and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source socio-ecologies. Systems model of creativity and proxy metrics for measuring potential for collective creativity are utilized to conduct a simulation study of open source software socio-ecologies. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.},

  abstract={The majority of work on artificial neural networks (ANNs) playing the game of Go focus on network architectures and training regimes to improve the quality of the neural player. A less investigated problem is the board representation conveying the information on the current state of the game to the network. Common approaches suggest a straight-forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game. We compare three different board representations for self-learning ANNs on a 5 times 5 board employing temporal difference learning (TDL) with two types of move selection (during training). The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality. A tournament of the best neural players, addition of alpha-beta search, and a commented game of a neural player against the best computer player further explore the potential of the neural players and its respective board representations},

  abstract={This paper presents a simulation model for observing the dynamics of a research community in engineering. The objective is to study how parameters, like group expertise and resources, influence the effectiveness of the group and community as a whole. The model implements a game-theoretic approach in which every group maximizes the difference between its rewards and costs (e.g., time and resources). Experiments studied the total reward and the number of problems solved over time by a community made of twenty groups for different conditions, i.e. allocated resources and group characteristics.},

  abstract={In the contemporary healthcare sector, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) carries substantial ramifications for practitioners of medicine. Emotional intelligence is becoming an increasingly significant asset for medical professionals, especially in light of the integration of AI technologies into clinical processes, encompassing the ability to perceive, comprehend, and regulate emotions. This research examines the various dynamics of EI within the framework of AI integration, illustrating its importance in numerous domains. An increasing number of medical practitioners are collaborating with AI-driven systems, which creates a nuanced relationship between the analytical prowess of AI and the emotive intelligence of humans; thus, a balance must be maintained. Additionally, this study examines the effects of EI on critical facets of medical education, interactions between practitioners and patients, and overall job satisfaction. This abstract advocates for a stance that underscores the criticality of bolstering EI talents in the face of technological advancements. A harmonious integration that acknowledges the potential conflicts and synergies between EI and AI to support both the cognitive and affective aspects of healthcare practice.},

  abstract={This paper describes a functional model for understanding the multiple roles that internal behavior modeling plays in an integrated functional architecture of the brain. Using a protocol for AI structure that is based on system engineering principles, we can look at the individual's process for understanding the behavior of, and interaction with, other entities. The analysis shows a complex inter-relationship between behavior models, motivations, and location models in the brain that allow us to interact with our environment with minimum demand on our mental resources.},

  abstract={The use of information and communication technology has evolved tremendously in the last decade. The dependency on this technology is an integral part of any business operations to achieve their strategic goal, which means compromise to any of these components, can severely disrupt and jeopardise business activities and can also bring a bad name to their reputation. As technology is becoming more sophisticated, there is a rise in more organised cyber-attacks. Organisations struggle to develop an effective Cyber security strategy, mainly because more user awareness is required in the domain. Since the number of Internet users and the integration of technologies in our lives is increasing exponentially. Humans live in a cyber social system, in which they interact with smart infrastructure. Attackers exploit humans as the weakest link to execute successful security breaches and gain an advantage in the lucrative cybercrime market. There is a dire need to address new challenges posed by cybercriminals and mitigate risks to human digital lives.},

  abstract={Digitalisation is the defining concept of the 21st century. Today, there is no area of life that is not digitised, not connected to the internet in some way, not connected to an online platform where the actor or solution is available. Digitalisation cannot be excluded from the education system either. Higher education has long taken advantage of the opportunities offered by digitisation, which greatly facilitates the lives of individuals involved in education. It is an effective and good solution for the educators, but it is also an equally effective and good solution for the learners. In this study, we want to assess the impact of digitalisation on the competitiveness of education and the perceptions of those involved in education, students and learners. We want to assess how the competitiveness of education as a key area can be improved by moving part of education from the physical space to the digital space and how this is received by those involved in education. In this paper, we will present our findings and the context that determines and judges the current state of the art of this issue based on the results of a Hungarian primary research.},

  abstract={ChatGPT is a novel AI tool that poses new questions for experts in education and introduces a need to change traditional instructional and grading systems. The first step towards a successful integration of ChatGPT into educational processes is to understand how students currently use it. In this paper we present our contribution towards this goal, a pilot study analyzing the results of a questionnaire filled out by 300 students of secondary and tertiary education. Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.},
