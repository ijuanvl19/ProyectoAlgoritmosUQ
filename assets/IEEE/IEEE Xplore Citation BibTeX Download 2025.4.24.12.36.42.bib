  abstract={Until relatively recently, technology has been used as a passive tool that makes the learner a user of various applications. However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out. The results obtained indicate that they have been able to master the new vocabulary, assimilate the concepts and work for themselves with the chosen tool to carry out the intervention.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Problems involving human activity systems contain a soft element which makes them hard to resolve using traditional approaches. Teaching programming is no difference in this regard. The presence of numerous factors makes it a complex and messy situation. However, one key contributor to this problem is the differences in perception of the parties involved. This paper aims to analyze the problem of teaching programming within a computer science department at Omar Elmukhtar University (OMU) through the application of soft system methodology SSM, in addition to investigating the effects and benefits of using such an approach in order to suggest a solution. Through constructing a root definition and conceptual model, we were able to provide a standard to which the current organization can be compared against, and therefore, achieve a better understanding regarding which changes need to be carried out in order to attain the system's desired results.},

  abstract={One of the ways to demonstrate subject-domain concepts is to let the learner play in the domain-related sandbox, while receiving the explanations of the domain laws that were broken when the user makes a wrong move. This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong.},

  pages={123-126},
  abstract={Mobile programming is one of the fastest growing approaches in many fields, such as marketing or e-commerce. From the educational perspective, this means that students should understand that they can build mobile applications (apps) without being professionals, and at the same time recognize their own potential to use technology in any professional path they choose. This goal is not trivial, even if students are in general curious and open to learn about the creation of apps. Indeed, especially in liberal education, students get discouraged upfront as they perceive programming as a difficult task. This paper describes a course that was cre- ated to fit the educational needs of a social-economic high school. Students take part of an interdisciplinary project in which the Software Engineering process is used to promote CT skills. The course was repeated twice and involved 29 students (8th and 9th grade).},

  abstract={Studies indicate that students, particularly females, find computing most engaging when it is presented in relation to real-life problems, rather than when it is presented in ways that emphasize computing for the sake of computing. Video scenarios are a novel tool for encouraging students to explore computing in a problem-centric, rather than a code-centric, manner. Video scenarios are short films (2-5 minutes long) that depict individuals facing problems in life-like settings. The scenarios emphasize the diverse and often ill-defined nature of real world problems, and the potential for creative and entrepreneurial computing they present. The video scenarios and their associated discussion/exercise questions are freely available on the web at www.Virt-U.org.},

  pages={T2C-16-T2C-17},
  abstract={Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code. The goal was to ascertain the kinds of mistakes that are often made, and how a technique like this could be most effective.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress, innovative practice paper describes the design and implementation of a computer programming project that encouraged students to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT). This innovative practice was implemented at a state university in an introduction to programming course. Course assessments included weekly homework assignments, an open-ended project, one quiz, and three midterm exams. Students were explicitly told in class and in the syllabus that no AI was allowed for weekly homework assignments; however, students were encouraged to use AI for the open-ended project. This decision was made because the problems on weekly assignments were more structured and could be easily solved by AI tools. In comparison, the learning objective of the project was focused on code design with open-ended requirements making it harder for AI to provide workable code. Students who reported using AI indicated that they used it to help start the project and/or a piece of the project and to aid in debugging or finding errors. Project grades were similar to grades seen in previous years for similar projects; however, grades on midterm two, which occurred after the project, were surprisingly higher than the grades for midterm one and higher than exam grades from previous years on similar topics. At this point, we do not know if/how the project contributed to these improved exam scores. Given the success of the project in its first implementation, Dr. E plans to use the assignment in future semesters. Additionally, Dr. C plans to collect data to begin exploring how the use of AI tools in this open-ended project supported students' learning and understanding of principles in the course.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Design of new strategies according to game models has been a general approach from the start. There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.},

  pages={184-188},
  abstract={This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).},

In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This practice work-in-progress paper describes an innovative laboratory course designed to introduce a heterogenous cohort of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering and science to the principles of designing and analyzing complex electronic systems. The course utilizes a self-developed drum machine as a visual and acoustic project with a gradually increasing level of complexity throughout the lab sessions. Through active participation students acquire an understanding of SPICE simulations, test & measurement equipment, and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The course is mandatory for students pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical, mechatronic, biomedical, computational, and information system engineering, and is also attended as an optional module by computer science and physics students. In the winter term of 2022, the course returned to the lab after the COVID-19 pandemic and was attended by more than 200 students. The laboratory experiments are supported by complementary activities, such as SPICE simulations of the circuits as preparation, and lab reports written in LaTeX to introduce the students to scientific writing. Instructional videos and consultation hours are offered to assist with SPICE simulation and LaTeX. During the physical lab sessions, students work in groups of three in a traditional laboratory environment, with student tutors available to provide guidance offered in the form of minimal help. Overall, the presented lab course is an innovative and engaging method of teaching electronic systems. The self-developed drum machine provides a visually and audibly stimulating project, allowing students to learn practical skills and develop their theoretical knowledge.},

  abstract={It is necessary to develop students to become lifelong learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to meet the challenges in the 21st century. Therefore, the STEM research center of Universitas Syiah Kuala in collaboration with other stakeholders in education, namely government, industry, public, and media has launched the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Character (STEMC) learning approach. There are six aspects to be developed through the STEMC approach: critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, computational thinking, and characters. In general, the nature of STEMC is not only a process of transferring knowledge from teachers to students but also an effort to build students' character. STEMC approach is designed to improve students' scientific abilities, motivation, and perseverance. It means that every phase of learning is designing to support students' intellectual and emotional growth. This paper aims to address what has been done at the STEM Research Center of Universitas Syiah Kuala and the plan for integrating STEMC in Indonesia. It provides an overview of some projects that have been conducted, such as the development of STEMC modules for senior high schools and collaboration with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in teacher professional development programs. In addition, this paper also highlights the STEM center's plan to implement STEMC in Indonesia},

This democratisation of visualization challenges educators to develop effective learning strategies, in order to train the next generation of creative visualization specialists. There is high demand for skilled individuals who can analyse a problem, consider alternative designs, develop new visualizations, and be creative and innovative. Our three-stage framework, leads the learner through a series of tasks, each designed to develop different skills necessary for coming up with creative, innovative, effective, and purposeful visualizations. For that, we get the learners to create an explanatory visualization of an algorithm of their choice. By making an algorithm choice, and by following an active-learning and project-based strategy, the learners take ownership of a particular visualization challenge. They become enthusiastic to develop good results and learn different creative skills on their learning journey.},

  abstract={We have been exploring a variety of computerized techniques for analyzing student writing in introductory biology. We achieve computer-to-expert inter-rater reliability (IRR) on par with expert-to-expert IRR (> .8). In Fall, 2012, we piloted the use of automated text analysis to facilitate the use of written formative assessment for Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in a large-enrollment introductory biology course at a large public Midwestern university. A total of 12,677 student responses to 15 online homework questions were collected in three 300+ student course sections with four instructors. We used automated analysis to create feedback for instructors before the next class period (less than one working day), so that instructions could use this feedback to inform their instruction. Instructors used many of the questions pre- and post-instruction and the reports we provided to them allowed them to see how their students' answers changed as a result of their instruction. Focus groups with the instructors revealed that they already knew some of the topics that challenged students, as revealed in previous semesters with multiple-choice examinations. However, the instructors pointed out that the written assessments were particularly important for gaining insight as to why students have struggled continuously with these ideas.},

  abstract={The article proposes an canvas-oriented approach to game design. It justifies the applying of a dynamic cycle of interconnected canvases into creative game design, for the purpose of documenting the progress and results of the creative process, stimulating it while canvases simultaneously are both clues and guides in game development. The author's definition of game design canvasation as a process of creation of a visual abstract structure that generalizes the case goal (the task containing the accumulated experience) for achieving it and creating a unique creative product is given. Projects “Canvas of Player Psychotypes & Aethteticts”, “Canvas of Player's needs in Control, Information and Action”, “Canvas of Game Mechanics & Dynamics”, “Canvas of Narrative”, “Canvas of the Game World”, “Canvas of Game Level” “Canvas of Ethical Dilemma” are presented. Canvases structure the game development process, reduce the time taken to generate game designer ideas and to contrive game mechanic and dynamics. Canvases are an additional road map toward making creative decisions in game design. They can be a convenient basis for automating the process of latter, a paper prototype of the game and the game design as a quest process provided that each canvas is a location with quest tasks, the variability of which depends on the potential and attitude of the leader and team. Subsequently, it is planned to develop algorithm for routing the components of the canvases also will be developed, allowing to automate the process of filling out sections of the Game Design Document.},

  abstract={Hepatitis C virus is a massive health issue affecting significant portions of the world's population. Applying data preprocessing, feature reduction techniques, and generating rules based on the selected features for classification tasks are considered as important steps in the knowledge discovery in databases. This paper highlights a Rough-Granular Neural Networks model that incorporates Rough Sets and Artificial Neural Networks to make efficient data analysis and suggestive predictions. The Rough Sets is used as a powerful analysis tool for data pre-processing. It is used to reduce and choose the most relevant attributes for reducing the number of input vector to Artificial Neural Networks without reducing the basic knowledge of the information system. This is done to increase Classification accuracy of the proposed model. Resulting optimal data set is input to constructed neural network with supervised learning algorithm for classifying studied cases for testing new medication for HCV treatment. The experimental results show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the proposed model is a superlative result.},

  abstract={Today, manufacturing enterprises must respond quickly to the ever-changing market environment in order to survive. At the same time, dynamic disturbances in production sites such as machine failures, reworking caused by quality problems, and changes of processing time and personnel will also have negative impacts on the effectiveness of the original plan. In order to ensure the feasibility of scheduling algorithms in highly dynamic environment, this paper presents agent-based rescheduling negotiation mechanisms with five dynamic disturbances, and verifies its feasibility through simulations. A multi-agent system structure with quick responses and simple communication networks is designed according to characteristics of hybrid flow shops, with which the processing of jobs can be easily traced back.},
