  abstract={To improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment, a framework of parallel healthcare systems (PHSs) based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) approach is proposed in this paper. PHS uses artificial healthcare systems to model and represent patients’ conditions, diagnosis, and treatment process, then applies computational experiments to analyze and evaluate various therapeutic regimens, and implements parallel execution for decision-making support and real-time optimization in both actual and artificial healthcare processes. In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.},

  title={The Deep Sleep Optimizer: A Human-Based Metaheuristic Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={83639-83665},
  abstract={Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.},

  abstract={In mid-April 2020, UNESCO monitored 191 countries and stated that around 1.723 trillion students in the world were affected by the policy of school from home. It is feared that school closures could hamper the provision of education services and could disrupt the education process which will affect the level of quality of education. There is still no creation of a computational model for the spread of covid as the main framework for schools reopening safely during the pandemic situation. Although there is already a framework from WHO and the government, there is no measuring tool that can evaluate the effect of reopening schools while the Covid-19 pandemic. For this reason, this research seeks to produce a model for the spread of Covid-19 as a basis for determining policies for safely reopening schools during the pandemic. In this research, we produced a recommendation to reopen face-to-face learning in the form of a dashboard. Recommendations are given by predicting the number of cases in each subdistrict using a predictive model. The prediction results are also combined with the factors that have been determined by the government to give recommendations. The allotment of recommendations process involves a critical factor analysis process where we identify which factors are dominant as a basis of a controllable pandemic.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},

  title={Applying Game Learning Analytics to a Voluntary Video Game: Intrinsic Motivation, Persistence, and Rewards in Learning to Program at an Early Age}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},

  pages={123588-123602},
  abstract={Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This paper introduces Data Brushes, an interactive web application to explore neural style transfer using models trained on data visualizations. Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to engage with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, `magic markers', mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, `compositing stamps', uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art in order to investigate the versatility and flexibility of the algorithm. In addition to enabling a novel creative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effects particular networks have on different images, or different regions within a single image. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of style transfer features.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. In the last few decades, a silent revolution is taking place. The exponential growth in microelectronic processing power has been achieved by ever decreasing the size of integrated circuits. These circuits which integrate electrical, mechanical and sometimes optical devices, have evolved from silicon revolution. It replaced big complex, costly systems with small, affordable, high performance microsystems. Microsystems are expected to further enable silicon chips to sense, "think", act, and communicate, in essence, to become intelligent machines. Structures of current microsystems are approaching fundamental limits and the next generation of devices might show unexpected properties due to quantum effects and fluctuations. A new research field is developing in which we pursue understanding of basic physics associated with such quantum structures, explore their controllability, and propose new devices. In this talk, we begin with a summary of engineering problem solving and proceed to discuss the impact of technology on the development of newly emerging discipline of soft computing and computational intelligence. The relationship between technology and intelligent mechatronics are pointed out.},

  abstract={Micro-expression refers to facial expressions that last for an extremely short time, typically less than 0.5 seconds. It can reveal a person's true emotion, which is one of the powerful indicators to judge what a person actually thinks. However, the deployment of micro-expression recognition algorithms onto resource-constrained devices poses a challenge due to their high computational requirements. In this essay, we optimize the identification of microexpression algorithms by using pruning-based lightweight methods. By using unstructured pruning and structured pruning methods, the backbone Resnet-18 network model is subjected to local and global lightweight pruning, respectively, where the network structure is optimized to reduce the time and space costs required for micro-expression recognition algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the original algorithm's performance is enhanced following the pruning procedure with fewer parameters, and it exhibits superior performance on the CASMEII, SMIC, and SAMM datasets.},

  abstract={We present a practical and efficient stereo matching approach which produces a dense disparity map with the pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming in this paper. Firstly, pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on the dynamic programming is introduced where the optimal alignment of two sequences could be acquired by tracing back the similarity matrix which is constructed according to characters in two sequences using dynamic programming algorithm. Second, we think of pixel gray value of all homonymy epipolar lines in two images in turn as two string sequences, and then disparity of corresponding point in two images is calculated by the number of gaps inserted the optimal alignment in every two string sequences. Additionally, according to epipolar constraint we can know that homonymy epipolar lines in two images parallel to the scan-lines, so the 2D matching of images is simplified to that of 1D. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach is stable and efficient, and it has a high matching accuracy and low computational complexity.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence explores the means for computers to think like a human. In this era of technological advancements, the unobstructed method for monitoring activities in daily life is a challenging task. Most of the recent research successfully achieved good performance at the high computational cost. With high computational costs, it is not possible to deploy action recognition methods in real-time scenarios. This research work aims to develop an action classification approach for video surveillance with scalable extension for deployment on edge devices. The input video is preprocessed extensively to extract the maximum information about the actions with all variants, which enables the network to even recognize the actions from an unseen environment. The Hybrid Video Classification (HVC) is the combination of CNN and GRU that are used for feature selection and preserving the preceding information, and in the end, SoftMax activations are used to classify the action labels. We have used HMDB51 and UT-Interaction datasets to train our proposed model. The model is tested in real-time on low end laptop. The experimentation shows that the proposed work recognizes the actions with better accuracy at a low computation cost.},

  pages={182-193},
  abstract={While Agent-Based Models can create detailed artificial societies based on individual differences and local context, they can be computationally intensive. Modelers may offset these costs through a parsimonious use of the model, for example by using smaller population sizes (which limits analyses in sub-populations), running fewer what-if scenarios, or accepting more uncertainty by performing fewer simulations. Alternatively, researchers may accelerate simulations via hardware solutions (e.g., GPU parallelism) or approximation approaches that operate a tradeoff between accuracy and compute time. In this paper, we present an approximation that combines agents who ‘think alike’, thus reducing the population size and the compute time. Our innovation relies on representing agent behaviors as networks of rules (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) and empirically evaluating different measures of distance between these networks. Then, we form groups of think-alike agents via community detection and simplify them to a representative agent. Case studies show that our simplifications remain accuracy.},

  abstract={Within the context of Argentina universities that have computer science degrees in their curricula, one of the major challenges is to teach an introductory programming course for the first semester. The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.},

  abstract={Significant gap between software programming model and execution model is one major slowing factor in the development of the emerging field of Internet-of-Things. It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.},

  abstract={In Norway, a health reform was recently adopted to improve continuity of care. Services that were carried out in hospitals were transferred to municipalities. Small and medium size municipalities have established inter-municipal cooperation to provide specialized services across borders. The research project eHealth-extended Care Coordination studied the inter-municipal cooperation for assessment of dementia, identifying a need for improved communication and coordination. This paper presents the development process of a collaborative information system for dementia assessment using a user-centered design approach. Mixed methods, such as observations, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire, were used for data collection. The results showed that end-user involvement usefully informed the development. The information system effectively supported collaborative work and shared access to information for the inter-municipal team.},

  abstract={Industry placements have been lauded as providing benefits to students, industry and academia. While semester-long placements that require a break from study are reported as the most effective, not all students want to extend their course. Short-term placements can also have positive outcomes for student employability, industry skilled-worker supply and enhancement of curriculum. Assessment of student performance though is challenging, as their focus during the placement needs to be on completing tasks for a sponsor. This paper is a case study of a successful short-term placement program used to identify the important factors and components of an assessment scheme for a short-term placement.},

  abstract={ChatGPT is a relatively recent application, free to the general public, released at the end of November 2022 and rooted in artificial intelligence. The educational community is still debating how such an application could be used in the teaching and learning area, with the facilities it offers and the risks it entails. The purpose of this paper is to present how such an application responds to physics topics at the high school level, and to suggest ways to use it properly. In order to cover the issue comprehensively, it is approached from both the teacher's and the student's point of view.},

  abstract={Project Jupyter is an open-source project for interactive computing widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},

  abstract={The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating new dimensions and redefining the concept and meaning of work in industrial settings. Documented success has been reported where AI is transforming industrial scenes such as scaling large operation processes, speed of execution, flexibility of processes where rigid manufacturing by dumb robots is replaced with smart individualized production following real-time customer choices, decision-making in which a huge amount of data can be quickly available at the fingertips of workers on the factory floor or even prevent problems before they happen, and personalization where AI uses data to deliver personalized user experience. According to the market research firm Trac tica, the global AI software market is expected to experience massive growth in the coming years, with revenues increasing from around US $9.5 billion in 2018 to an expected US $118.6 billion by 2025.},
