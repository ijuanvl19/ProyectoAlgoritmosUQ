  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.},

  abstract={Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to provide meaningful scaffolding to bachelor humanities students, to enabled them to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) technical skills, and in particular basic programming competences. Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.},

  abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key resource for the study of brain function, and the interaction between computer and machine through EEG has become a new computer interaction mode. This project intends to study the EEG - computer interaction model based on facial expression. A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-2},
  abstract={A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.},

  pages={52-62},
  abstract={This article constitutes an effort to gain insights into the nature of creativity and its mechanisms leading to creative solutions to problems. This article claims that reflection constitutes the underlying mechanism, serving as a catalyst for creativity. A total of five experiments is presented, incurred in industrial and academic research environments and pedagogical settings, that demonstrate the occurrence of creativity, deliberately triggered by reflection. The key contribution of this article is that, although the exact definition of creativity continues to elude us, two mechanisms have been uncovered that are potentially useful in triggering creativity, at will, in ordinary scientific and engineering personnel to achieve quantum leaps in our knowledge and achievement. Reflection plays a key, catalytic role in both of these mechanisms and also appears to underlie the inner workings of Nature.},

  year={2023},
  volume={15},

  pages={1170-1182},
  abstract={From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large "linguistic receptive fields." Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.},

  abstract={According to Henry Jenkins, Transmedia storytelling is defined as "Transmedia storytelling (TMS) represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story." (Jenkins 2007) In recent years, this technique is becoming popular in Europe and America. A creator needs to combine "Flow of story" and "Story experience" at a stage of planning a TMS project. Also, it is hard to build an elaborate plan; the world view of the story, time base, and how to invite the audience to participate in the experience. In this study, we propose the method of visualizing a structure of the entire story with a possible tree-structure model assumed from content elements that users are thinking about when they start to work on a TMS project.},

  abstract={In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for better communication between collaborating engineers and between engineer and entity generation processes at the definition of products in modeling systems. The authors recognized the importance of correct human-computer- human communication by using of product model as a special medium for engineers. In order to establish a product model that is appropriate for this purpose, they integrated all influencing effects on a product in an influencing space. In order to record content of influencing by engineers and other influencing persons, authorities, etc., the currently prevailing information based product model is completed by representation of information content. This paper emphasizes some relevant issues of information content. Definition of this contents starts from modeling of human intent. Intent model is consists of information about the owner of an intent, characteristics of that intent, and representation of content of intent in some form of knowledge. Information content is organized in the interconnected intent, behavior, and decision spaces. In a hierarchical system, intent space is at the highest and decision space is at the lowest level hierarchy assuring human intent based automation of decision making on engineering object in an improved product model.},

Description of parts and units of products have been completed by related objects such as results of analyses, interacting humans, equipment control programs, rules, and so on. Humans define these objects by using of contextual connections. Considering current product modeling, the next step of development is application of achievements from the area of intelligent computing at the definition of engineering objects in product models. This paper introduces a method for the application of knowledge based decision making in order to replace the conventional direct definition of engineering objects in model based product development. The authors developed a new modeling method on the basis of their earlier proposed concept of information content.

  abstract={The wall between computer science and electrical engineering has kept the potential of embedded systems at bay. It is time to build a new scientific foundation with embedded systems design as the cornerstone, which will ensure a systematic and even-handed integration of the two fields. The embedded systems design problem certainly raises technology questions, but more important, it requires building a new scientific foundation that will systematically and even-handedly integrate computation and physicality from the bottom up. Support for this foundation will require enriching computer science paradigms to encompass models and methods traditionally found in electrical engineering.},

  abstract={Knowledge bases are a fundamental platform for knowledge acquisition, retaining, retrieval, reasoning and generation across machine learning, natural language processing and computational intelligence. The mathematical model of formal concepts is centric in knowledge bases for modeling the basic unit of human knowledge and thinking threads. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cognitive knowledge base. The structure of the knowledge base is created as a dynamic concept network mimicking human knowledge represented in the brain. The knowledge base enables a set of novel knowledge manipulations for machine learning such as knowledge acquisition, access, analysis, refinement, fusion and system maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the implementation of the generic knowledge base for cognitive robots and machine learning systems.},

  title={Prompting Large Language Models With the Socratic Method},

  pages={0351-0360},
  abstract={This paper presents a systematic approach to using the Socratic method in developing prompt templates that effectively interact with large language models, including GPT-3. Various methods are examined, and those that yield precise answers and justifications while fostering creativity and imagination to enhance creative writing are identified. Techniques such as definition, elenchus, dialectic, maieutics, generalization, and counterfactual reasoning are discussed for their application in engineering prompt templates and their connections to inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning. Through examples, the effectiveness of these dialogue and reasoning methods is demonstrated. An interesting observation is made that when the task's goal and user intent are conveyed to GPT-3 via ChatGPT before the start of a dialogue, the large language model seems to connect to the external context expressed in the intent and perform more effectively.},

  title={The Effect of Virtual Humans Making Verbal Communication Mistakes on Learners’ Perspectives of their Credibility, Reliability, and Trustworthiness}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={455-463},
  abstract={Simulating real-world experiences in a safe environment has made virtual human medical simulations a common use case for research and interpersonal communication training. Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.},
