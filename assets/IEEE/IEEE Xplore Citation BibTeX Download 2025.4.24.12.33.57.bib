  abstract={The borderline separating users on the Internet is limited to the classical object-system identifiers such as users-login-ID, and network parameters, which is assumed to belong to a benign user. These assumptions provide subtle platform for malicious action in addition to exploitation of the vulnerability in online anonymity. The study proposes a human-system identifier framework based on the integration of psychosocial attributes of human into Internet traffic classification process, such that sufficient unique psychographics demography of users can be extracted. Such user psychographic characterization can be complementary method in user identification process. The implication of this paradigm can be adapted for insider investigation process, online transaction authentication process, e-commerce modeling. Further, it finds relevance in network management, especially in a mono-demographical culture.},

  abstract={Advanced engineering uses highly integrated modeling that serves product development and application for lifecycle. In the course of a group work, communication between engineers is done increasingly through complex product model. This paper analyzes this new function of product model and recognizes that current product models can not provide for its efficient support. In this context, poor representation of decision background is considered as main cause of the communication shortage. As a possible contribution to better communication, the author proposed a new information content based extension to currently prevailing product model in the form of a new sector. This paper introduces and discusses a new development in the above mentioned extension in order to establish a contextual chain of model entities from human intent, through objectives for product and contextual connections to decisions. The proposed new method is devoted to enhance current professional product modeling on the way towards human defined, company related, verified, and authorized and responsible engineer controlled intelligence of engineering modeling. Paper starts with an introduction and evaluation of the above cited information content based extension to currently prevailing product model. Following this, the proposed new contextual modeling of background of decisions on engineering objects is discussed. This modeling provides support for decision making at the application of product model and collecting experiences and methods for similar problems in the future. As the main part of the paper, new contextual content entities are proposed. Finally, some words are devoted for future plans of research in the proposed intelligent engineering method.},

  abstract={This paper arises from work ongoing in the GALA (Games and Learning Alliance - Network of Excellence for Serious Games). As part of GALA, a comprehensive state of the art analysis of existing serious games for the business and industry domain (loosely defined) was undertaken. A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The "simulation level" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.},

Video-based lectures and materials are to be referred before the actual class as a pre-class activity in the flipped classroom setting and completion status are evaluated through learner's feedback. In this paper, pre-class activities are evaluated by applying process mining on the student's clickstream data generated through learning platform “Delta” designed for current work. The students are categorized as credible and mediocre performers based on their pre-assessment score and process models are generated by applying fuzzy miner and heuristic miner based on their engagement with the tool. We further analyzed and registered the absolute & relative occurrences of events, identified a contrasting pattern in student behavior through trend analysis and process comparator. The various process models from learner's data were presented using several visualizations.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper describes results from a project in an undergraduate engineering physics course that coupled classroom use of interactive computer simulations with the collection of real-time formative assessment using pen-enabled mobile technology. Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.},

  abstract={Engineering for the development, application, and recycling of products is recently supported by fully integrated model of product. Prototyping is moving to virtual by the application of sophisticated product models for complex simulations. Simulations rely upon knowledge representing experience, expertise and intelligence of engineers in knowledge wares. Increasing proportion of this knowledge is placed in the product model in the form of active rules, checks, and reactions. In case of any change of these knowledge representations, relevant product model entities are modified accordingly. This knowledge must be verified by practice. Consequently, interaction of virtual and physical worlds is anticipated as a main area for future research in product model based virtual engineering systems. The authors developed and published a novel knowledge based method for the definition of product objects during the recent years. In this paper, they conceptualize a possible integration of intelligent sensor networks with active knowledge in product models. They propose introduction of physical information space in order to receive engineering object related information from preprocessed sensor data. The proposed novel method is based on intelligent capabilities both in sensor and product modeling.},

  pages={117-122},
  abstract={Two main recent achievements of the first decade in this new century in model space based during product definition are representation of corporate knowledge in product model and extended application of contextual feature principle. Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.},

  abstract={Concept elicitation is a fundamental methodology for knowledge extraction and representation in cognitive robot learning. Traditional machine learning technologies deal with object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, and behavior acquisition. This paper presents a supervised machine knowledge learning methodology for concept elicitation from sample dictionaries in natural languages. Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base. The results of machine-generated concepts demonstrate that the AMCE algorithm can over perform human knowledge expressions in dictionaries in terms of relevance, accuracy, quantitativeness, and cohesiveness.},

  abstract={Learning to use computational tools is a critical aspect of many first-year engineering courses. Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers.},

  abstract={This paper is a sequel to “A novel approach to evolutionary computing: an introduction” in which I describe how the modern software can be viewed as a complex adaptive system and how software evolution can be placed or mapped in parallel to the Darwinian Evolution Theory of biology. Calling it a novel approach to evolutionary computing because, instead of working toward genetic computational approaches to biology, it studies complex adaptive systems in software as if software is the same among biological populations that abide by evolutionary theories of biology. This paper explores the relationship between complexity study as a scientific endeavor and systems thinking as a problem solving skill while approaching to generic software solutions, known as Computational Intelligence, to any problem of our interests at hand. The paper argues that skills in systems thinking are critical and applying them may add values to software development activities, especially to large-scale complex software aiming for the high quality and rapid productivity. Examples will be provided to support arguments in the paper.},

  abstract={The computation technology is evolving. The data transmitted and generated using them are growing exponentially. The traffic on these networks requires surveillance. Effective network traffic surveillance, packet analysis and rules to define the traffic flow are in place using various intrusion detection and prevention systems. However, the security issues and concerns are dictating the need to evolve with the novel and `human-like' methods to mitigate them. Normal methods and techniques may prove too tedious, and sometimes will not even render fruitful results. In that case, the techniques that can think, act and mimic human beings assure the possibilities of resolving the concerns where the domain of artificial intelligence plays a critical role. Also, there is a crucial need to design real-time models that can analyze & handle bigger, more complex data; and deliver faster as well as accurate results. Machine learning is a subfield which possesses all of the attributes. Intrusion preventions IDPS's integrate methods that help to prevent intrusive and non-intrusive data packets [2]. According to survey, most of the intrusion prevention methods rely heavily on humans to analyze data and classify into intrusive and non-intrusive networks. When the data to compute is very large, computing methods such as Computational intelligence and its constituent are essential to use as humans have their own shortcomings. Computational intelligence and machine learning are widely used to detect the intrusions, which in turn help in preventing the same. Pattern recognition uses algorithms to handle very large data sets. In this paper, a survey is done that on various machine learning and computational intelligence techniques that envisage using IDPS.},
