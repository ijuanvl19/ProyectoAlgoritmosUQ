  abstract={Quantum mechanics is a fundamental, axiom-based physical theory that describes and explains phenomena that Classical Mechanics and Electrodynamics are unable to describe. It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature’s real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. Certain Python libraries and packages are used and the didactic approach is based on game-based inquiry learning.},

  number={5},
  pages={33-39},
  abstract={Natural language's creative genres are traditionally considered to be outside the scope of computational modeling. Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text? And can we automatically insert humorous add-ons into existing applications?},

  title={Impact of Enhanced Learning Approaches on STEM-Focused Education for School Children in Assam, India},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In today's growing digital era, young students' emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. Traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. On the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. Incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. The novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in Assam, India, which enhances the participating students' self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. This study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. Academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. The data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. A set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through pre/post-tests and draw-a-robot activity. This study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohen’s d = 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for STEM education.},

  abstract={Our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study.},

  abstract={This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.},

  abstract={So far, we have proposed the Stress management framework and developed methods for stress measurement and coping. There are three types of coping in this framework: information support, emotional support, and esteem support. This time, we developed esteem support. In order to increase self-esteem, we focused on psychodrama techniques and developed a system to realize psychodrama using robots. The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.},

  abstract={The use of computational intelligence for leveraging social creativity is a relatively new approach that allows organizations to find creative solutions to complex problems in which the interaction between stakeholders is crucial. The creative solutions that come from joint thinking-from the combined knowledge and abilities of people with diverse perspectives-contrast with traditional views of creativity that focus primarily on the individual as the main contributor of creativity. In an effort to support social creativity in organizations, in this paper we present computational intelligence software tools for that aim and an architecture for creating software mashups based on the concept of affinity space. The affinity space defines a digital setting to facilitate specific scenarios in collaborative business environments. The solution presented includes a set of free and open source software tools ranging from newly developed brainstorming applications to an expertise recommender for enhancing social creativity in the enterprise. The current paper addresses software design issues and presents reflections on the research work undertaken in the COLLAGE project between 2012 and 2015.},

Smartphones with AR Bot app can be used to scan the AR Bot cards, and then enter the learning units that uses visual blocky programming editor to practice various robot tasks. The motions of virtual robot can be demonstrated in the authentic scenes with AR technology via mobile devices. The AR Bot system is designed to facilitate computational thinking and STEM education in K-12 schools. In the current state of this study, the core programming editor engine of AR Bot has been developed, and the researcher team will prepare to conduct the experiments into STEM courses in a primary school in Taiwan.

  abstract={Computational Archival Science (CAS) has been proposed as a trans-disciplinary field that combines computational and archival thinking. To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage. The Human Face of Big Data project, a digital curation and interface design project for urban renewal data, is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the validity of the suggested heuristics. Finally, implications for CAS and future work are discussed.},

First, because modeling has demonstrated its value for relatively simple tasks, practitioners are asking for help with tasks in increasingly complex domains. Second, as international interchanges increase in importance, military, corporate, and humanitarian leaders urgently need to capture and better understand national and regional differences. Computational modeling promises to be a powerful tool for representing complex tasks and testing the validity of these representations. Models might also support decision aids and serve as platforms for training. It's time to extend modeling to better accommodate complexity and to include the variations in behavior, roles, values, and cognition that influence international interchange.},

  pages={82848-82866},
  abstract={Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.},

In this sense, we performed a quasi-experiment with students in the Brazilian's Basic Education Regular System (particularly in a group of students around fifteen years old) comparing their performance after being trained with practical activities using exercises in more or less conformity with well known CT concepts and capabilities. Considering the quantitative results obtained, the experimental group outperformed the control group, which worked with exercises in more and less conformity with CT, respectively. The results were statistically significant, suggesting that bringing together CT and mathematics through proper adjustments of classroom practices can have a positive influence on students abilities of solving problems. In order to strengthen this conclusion we also performed a qualitative analysis comprising students and the teacher involved in the quasi-experiment that reinforced our quantitative results.},

  abstract={Developing students' Computational Thinking (CT), which is an essential problem-solving skill for people living in the 21st century, becomes an outstanding purpose of promoting engineering education in K-12 classrooms. In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.},

  abstract={Many countries have included or consider to include computational thinking in their educational curricula. This creates the need for a carefully planned educational approach involving different stakeholders as policymakers, educators and students. These stakeholders are the main carriers of the educational reforms thus their perspectives create various challenges and risks. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical approach of teaching coding through games and gamification of the learning process. The flipped classroom is used in order to address the shortcomings in teacher training and deliver learning outcomes in student-centred, fun and engaging way. Proposed solution includes a spiral curriculum implemented in 4 cycles that alternate cooperative and individual learning approach. The approach was evaluated with more than 199 students from 6 different schools. Evaluation analyses were focused on the achieved learning experience identifying differences between male and female students, as well as students with different level of access to ICT resources. The results confirm the benefits of the proposed solution.},

  abstract={The uniqueness of Augmented Reality (AR) is its affordance to support learning abstract concepts by rich information, visualization and the integration of user-content interaction. Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper evaluates an online programming course for K-12 educators that aimed to teach Computational Thinking (CT). CT is widely defined as a set of skills, such as problem solving and systems design, that rely on Computer Science principles. As these skills are increasingly demanded in modern society, it is critical to include CT in K-12 education to boost not only computing courses, but various other disciplines. However, most educators do not yet know the basics of CT and Computer Science fundamentals, particularly in Brazil. In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work.},

  abstract={The demand for additional engineering and computing degree graduates continue to increase [1, 2]; however, interest in pursuing these degrees is not matching the predicated demand. More specifically, attracting US students in engineering and computing field has always been a challenge; this is particularly true for female and minority students. Factors such as the "geek image", a demanding mathematical foundation, lack of "gee whiz" element early in the curriculum, and overall misconception about the career in these areas are all contributors to this problem. This paper describes some of our activities associated with the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) concepts to middle and high schools. The central tenet of the project is to entice students in grade 6-12 to learn some fundamental and advance topics in engineering and computing field, thereby recognizing their own ability to understand the computing and engineering topics, and potentially recognizing their interest in such topics and potential further education and career in these fields.},
