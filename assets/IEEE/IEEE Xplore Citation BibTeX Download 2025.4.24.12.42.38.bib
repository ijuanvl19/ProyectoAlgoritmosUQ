  abstract={Sensor network is one of the authoritative leading technology of current century. Security is the main concern for everything whether it is for wired based networks or wireless based networks. So far, many of the researches have thought to physically implement the sensor nodes and sensor networks for secure communications but they did not think over it for security perspective. Sensor network works in very resource constraint environment. Due to these security reasons, we present various protocols to provide the basic needs of data security that are: confidentiality, authentication, freshness and authenticated broadcasting because this broadcasting requires some techniques or protocols to securely communicate with other sensor node(s). Other issues in sensor networks are power management, computation overhead and low memory capacity.},

  abstract={Inspired by Minsky's Society of Mind, Schmidhuber's Learning to Think, and other more recent works, this paper proposes and advocates for the concept of natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs). We imagine these societies as consisting of a collection of multimodal neural networks, including large language models, which engage in a “mindstorm” to solve problems using a shared natural language interface. Here, we work to identify and discuss key questions about the social structure, governance, and economic principles for NLSOMs, emphasizing their impact on the future of AI. Our demonstrations with NLSOMs-which feature up to 129 agents-show their effectiveness in various tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, and prompt generation for text-to-image synthesis.},

  title={Exploring User Experience with Image Schemas, Sentiments, and Semantics}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={10},
  number={2},
  pages={182-195},
  abstract={Although the concept of user experience includes two key aspects, experience of meaning (usability) and experience of emotion (affect), the empirical work that measures both the usability and affective aspects of user experience is currently limited. This is particularly important considering that affect could significantly influence a user's perception of usability. This paper uses image schemas to quantitatively and systematically evaluate both these aspects. It proposes a method for evaluating user experience that is based on using image schemas, sentiment analysis, and computational semantics. The aim is to link the sentiments expressed by users during their interactions with a product to the specific image schemas used in the designs. The method involves semantic and sentiment analysis of the verbal responses of the users to identify (i) task-related words linked to the task for which a certain image schema has been used and (ii) affect-related words associated with the image schema employed in the interaction. The main contribution is in linking image schemas with interaction and affect. The originality of the method is twofold. First, it uses a domain-specific ontology of image schemas specifically developed for the needs of this study. Second, it employs a novel ontology-based algorithm that extracts the image schemas employed by the user to complete a specific task and identifies and links the sentiments expressed by the user with the specific image schemas used in the task. The proposed method is evaluated using a case study involving 40 participants who completed a set task with two different products. The results show that the method successfully links the users' experiences to the specific image schemas employed to complete the task. This method facilitates significant improvements in product design practices and usability studies in particular, as it allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of designs by identifying specific image schemas and product design features that have been positively or negatively received by the users. This allows user experience to be assessed in a systematic way, which leads to a better understanding of the value associated with particular design features.},

  abstract={There has been growing development of co-creative systems for game design, where both humans and computers work as colleagues, proactively contributing with creative input. However, the collaborative process is still not as seamless as in human-human co-creativity. A key element still underdeveloped in these approaches is the communication between the human and the machine, which can be facilitated by providing the computational agent with explanatory capabilities. Based on principles of explainability for co-creative systems from previous literature, we propose a framework of explainability specifically applied to mixed-initiative scenarios in game design. We illustrate the applications of the framework by suggesting possible solutions adapted to different use cases of existing approaches and, additionally, of our own proposed approach.},

  year={1996},
  volume={3},

  pages={1958-1964 vol.3},
  abstract={In engineering applications of fuzzy logic, the main goal is not to simulate the way the experts really think, but to come up with a good engineering solution that would (ideally) be better than the expert's control. In such applications, it makes perfect sense to restrict ourselves to simplified approximate expressions for membership functions. If we need to perform arithmetic operations with the resulting fuzzy numbers, then we can use simple and fast algorithms that are known for operations with simple membership functions. In other applications, especially the ones that are related to humanities, simulating experts is one of the main goals. In such applications, we must use membership functions that capture every nuance of the expert's opinion; these functions an therefore complicated, and fuzzy arithmetic operations with the corresponding fuzzy numbers become a computational problem. In this paper, we design a new algorithm for performing such operations. This algorithm uses fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) to reduce computation time from O(n/sup 2/) to O(nlog(n)) (when n is the number of points x at which we know the membership functions /spl mu/(x)). To compute FFT even faster, we propose to use special hardware.},

  abstract={In 1960, CBS aired a special issue entitled “The Thinking Machine” which featured three Western playlets scripted by a computer programmed by MIT researchers. Almost 60 years later, two researchers at Autodesk used a computer program to help design a chair. In this article, I link these two seemingly discrete examples of computational creativity in order to highlight how digital fabrication technologies have served as an important test site for defining human and computational expertise. I do so by illustrating how concepts of “creativity” and “routine” were produced alongside the concepts of computational creativity during the development of digital fabrication. This dichotomy of “creative” and “routine” is not only used to determine the kinds of tasks that are appropriate for humans and computers to perform within the design and production process, but it is also used to render invisible the embodied craft knowledge required to substantiate these systems.},

  abstract={This paper presents the results of our research into cooperation in Government Extended Enterprises, a type of system of systems. The effort proposed and evaluated a novel theory that these decisions are the result of the interaction of four canonical forces-Sympathy, Trust, Fear, and Greed. A computational simulation involving the Stag Hunt game examined information sharing decisions in a series of key decision points in three large case studies. For the five hypotheses tested, exploratory data analysis and nonparametric statistical testing show strong support for three of the hypotheses (cooperation is positively correlated with actors' levels of Sympathy and Trust and negatively correlated with actors' levels of Fear) and moderate support for the fourth (cooperation is negatively correlated with actors' levels of Greed). Indications are that the fifth hypothesis (cooperation is correlated with history of behavior) is not needed to explain observed behavior. Multiple correspondence analysis showed significant interactions both among pairs of forces and when a force is paired with decision making strategies. These results can form the basis for: 1) analysis of additional case studies; 2) development of an agent-based simulation; and 3) creation of training programs for current and future organizational leaders.},

To do so, it is necessary to incorporate skills that allow them to adapt this work philosophy, which is why in this work the use of competencies that allows to detonate social and cognitive aspects in the development of software in small teams was evaluated, as well as the frequency of use. It is also important to determine if the gender has any influence on the adoption of a certain trait. For this, groups of students were trained by developing computational problems in the field of data structure.},

  abstract={The authors of this paper introduced junior (3rd year BSc) students for the first time to the principles and practices of innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering design at Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates, in 2014. This included an overview of the techniques that managers in organizations and startup entrepreneurs use to initiate and manage innovation effectively. The course introduces four main phases of innovation and entrepreneurship: (i) identification of a new need or want; (ii) invention of a technological solution; (iii) testing and implementing that solution; and (iv) the mock-start of an entrepreneurial venture. These are explored at length. The course uses a hands-on approach to engage students in groups of four, to the full process of innovation and entrepreneurship from concept generation and selection, needs finding and screening leading to the development of viable financial strategies in their business plans. The innovation/entrepreneurship part of the course is taught in parallel with the design engineering part. The emphasis of the course is on the development of innovative and competitive needs-based solutions for real world engineering problems through the creation of prototypes and simulations. Students are taught "tools" to assist them: design modelling, problem-solving methods, ethical debate, reasoning and logic, and a business plan canvas to help them organize their thinking about business prospects in a realistic fashion.},

  abstract={Human simulation (applying Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to topics in the humanities, the interpretative social sciences, and the arts) is a potent extension of social simulation. This paper offers reflections on teaching at this intersection, presenting best practices in pedagogy for undergraduate and graduate students engaged in formal studies, and for established researchers having no structured curriculum. The fact that human simulation is possible drives home the presence of formal patterns in a host of phenomena that for a long time were thought to be inimical to mathematical analysis. That implies a double pedagogical challenge: teaching humanities students to recognize formal structures in the phenomena they study (counter-intuitive for them), and teaching M&S students to collaborate with humanities people who think very differently (equally counter-intuitive). The three perspectives presented here underline the usefulness of human simulation, as well as the difficulties and benefits associated with teaching and learning human simulation.},

  abstract={Facing the growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), high-performance and power-efficient AI accelerators are desired to provide effective and affordable cloud inference services. We introduce our flagship product, i.e., the Cloudblazer i20 accelerator, which integrates the innovated Deep Thinking Unit (DTU 2.0). The design is driven by requests drawn from various AI inference applications and insights learned from our previous products. With careful tradeoffs in hardware-software co-design, Cloudblazer i20 delivers impressive performance and energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable hardware costs and software complexity/flexibility. To tackle computation- and data-intensive workloads, DTU 2.0 integrates powerful vector/matrix engines and a large-capacity multi-level memory hierarchy with high bandwidth. It supports comprehensive data flow and synchronization patterns to fully exploit parallelism in computation/memory access within or among concurrent tasks. Moreover, it enables sparse data compression/decompression, data broadcasting, repeated data transfer, and kernel code prefetching to optimize bandwidth utilization and reduce data access overheads. To utilize the underlying hardware and simplify the development of customized DNNs/operators, the software stack enables automatic optimizations (such as operator fusion and data flow tuning) and provides diverse programming interfaces for developers. Lastly, the energy consumption is optimized through dynamic power integrity and efficiency management, eliminating integrity risks and energy wastes. Based on the performance requirement, developers also can assign their workloads with the entire or partial hardware resources accordingly. Evaluated with 10 representative DNN models widely adopted in various domains, Cloudblazer i20 outperforms Nvidia T4 and A10 GPUs with a geometric mean of 2.22x and 1.16x in performance and 1.04x and 1.17x in energy efficiency, respectively. The improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of Cloudblazer i20’s design that emphasizes performance, efficiency, and flexibility.},

  abstract={Sampling time and the prediction horizon length are two underlying design choices for the implementation of model predictive control (MPC). Smoothness properties of the open- and closed-loop value function with respect to the two parameters are essential to characterise for the purpose of providing knowledge that is useful in the context of MPC design optimisation to maximise system performance. Specifically, these properties are continuity, differentiability and monotonicity. This paper presents both numerical and analytical results to reveal the smoothness properties of the value function. Increasing sampling rate and/or prediction horizon does not necessarily improve closed-loop performance. Furthermore, the value function in open-loop under input constraints is differentiable, which may contradict the traditional thinking and expectations.},

Building a robot requires that the designer integrates control in electronic and mechanical systems and produces a working device, confronts the user with interactions, between different subsystems, and gives the designer the opportunity to trade off between the different subsystems in constructing an autonomous agent. The environment also encourages biomedical engineers to confront the issues involved in getting a physical agent to operate reliably in a realistic environment by giving them the opportunity to build their own animal, providing a unique perspective on the many problems that nervous systems actually solve.},

  abstract={Decision makers of today routinely encounter increasingly complex and interrelated problems, preceding the necessity for a large number of significant decisions to be dynamic in nature. Frequently rather than a single decision the requirement of a number of decisions exists, conventionally being interdependent on each other in an environment of progressive change. For thousands of years people have endeavoured to document observations of the environment and surroundings, with the aspiration of comprehending situations, which in turn enable a form of anticipation or prediction of the future. Through the contributions of a range of scientists and philosophers' humanity has affected the achievement of an improved quality of life, commencement of influence on the essence of life and encouragement to attempt to gain even further knowledge through travel to other planets. Without any doubt science is exceptional and dynamic and by far the optimum means of discovering the world and all that it encompasses. What hasn't changed is the curiosity, imagination and intelligence of those doing science [1]. Despite the fact that scientific discoveries and inventions invariably enhance life to a large degree as well as being accredited with expanding the expected lifespan of humans, scientific and technological improvements may equally precipitate alienation, loss of privacy, environmental problems (chemical and electronic waste), and a greater uncertainty or a black swan event. Science is perceived to be subject about knowledge with curiosity lying at the heart of it, differing from technology in that technology is preferably explained as doing. The 19th century scientist Pierre Laplace elevated determinism to a key place in science. He linked determinism and the ability to predict to the very notion of success in science [2]. For technical decisions science is an unrivalled tool to use, however, for managerial, institutional and personal daily life decisions the same recommendation cannot be given. Numerous key systems incorporated in the life of humans exhibit diverse complexities. Markets compromised of various buyers and sellers all categorized in groups participating in mutual funds, economies with hierarchies of workers, departments, firms, and industries; multi-celled organisms consisting of proteins, membranes, organelles, cells, and organs, the internet with users, stations, servers, and websites. Each of these complex systems exhibits a distinctive property called “emergence” roughly described by a phrase “the whole is more than the sum of the actions of the parts [3]. Scientists depend on the law of rationality; however, the fact that emotion habitually dominates humans on innumerable occasions is well recognized. Perhaps a more effective method for solving the problems of humanity should include deciphering the laws of human nature. As an alternative to the law of rationality, consideration could be given to whether it is preferable for scientists use the law of bounded rationality which may entail radical paradigm shift in scientific studies. The fundamental gap between the explicit accomplishments of knowledge acquisition in the natural sciences versus the rather minimal successes in understanding the dynamics of the social realm is the inherent nonlinearity, instability, and uncertainty of behaviour consistent with social systems. However, the possibility that an alternative strategy exists to close this gap is highly feasible. This article aims at showing the justification for the discarding the rule of rationality assumption in engagement and comprehension of scientific studies, and as a substitute insert human behaviours and emotions. Our emotional self is the principal power behind our creativity and passion and constitutes humanity. Controlling the nature may be easier than controlling the human nature. Today the study of chaos, and systemic thinking (emphasis is given to complexity, networks and patterns of organization) has emerged at the forefront of natural sciences too. Disquiet exists concerning events that may lead to the destruction of our civilization even the elimination of life on Earth. In 2050 the World population will reach 9.7 billion. There is also an urgent need to introduce eco-ethical standards into science. Decision making is not merely a science; there is a requisite for creative and individuality aspects of it to be examined. In the development of technologies, the human nature, psychological and sociological impacts of these technologies must be analysed in a holistic way. The main aim of the paper is to show that decision making especially under uncertainty is partly scientific partly heuristic or artistic phenomenon. The art side of decision making shouldn't be expelled from science.},

  abstract={Programming skills are an important component of an engineering curriculum, not only because they enable the customization of software tools to be used in the profession, but also (and perhaps more crucially) because of the "computational thinking" and problem solving capabilities that are ideally developed by young students who learn to program for the first time. The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS) ) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. This work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. The approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks Scratch, AppInventor, BYOB, and the well-known C/C++ language; curriculum material is drawn from CSPrinciples pilot courses, CS unplugged, school level preparation material for the International Olympiad in Informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. The pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. This paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10th/13th grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. Ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented. An initial analysis of the course results, both qualitative (based on two student surveys) and quantitative (based on formal written examinations) is presented and discussed. Results are encouraging, showing how visual programming languages help students to improve their problems solving skills and reasoning practices. Exposing the younger generation to computational concepts is fundamental in order to improve the mastering of these concepts and increase the success rate in university studies.},

  abstract={This Innovative-Practice Full Paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) in the biosciences. The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education.},

  abstract={Today, principles of finance are combined with advanced mathematical structures to form useful financial products, strategies and models that are tested and implemented with the use of advanced quantitative techniques. Use of computing technology is pervasive throughout this process. Quantitative and Computational Finance is an area referred to under a variety of names, for example, ‘computational finance’, ‘financial engineering’, and ‘mathematical finance’. But in all cases there is an effort that involves ‘financial’, ‘mathematical’, ‘quantitative’ and ‘computational’ thinking to build, test and implement models that are at the center of these financial activities. In the last decade Computational Finance (CF) has influenced the market place extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in numerous ways today. The time is, therefore, ripe now to bring together researchers in the areas of finance using complicated financial models to solve computationally intensive problems and computer scientists having the resources and solution methodologies to solve such problems. The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for these two groups to exchange and disseminate new ideas, techniques, and research in computational finance. Strong discussions will follow the presentations and the experience could lead them into the formulation, implementation of the models used by the practitioners in financial sector. This workshop will be a first such effort in bringing together researchers in the areas of finance and advanced computing (i) who develop and employ parallel and distributed computing extensively (ii) at a venue where parallel, distributed, high performance computing is the fundamental thread of discussions and arguments.},

  abstract={This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.},

  abstract={Blockchain is attracting more and more attentions from many kinds of fields, such as finance, industry, and theory researchers. Rather than viewing blockchain as a novel technology, we should think it as an innovation for managing digital society, which provides fundamental principles to support democratically distributed applications. Based on the design and application of the Energy Internet, this paper analyzes the core architecture of the initial blockchain technology, and combines the security of the public chain with the efficiency of the private chain, solving the poor efficiency problem of the initial blockchain by using the high efficiency of private chain. At the same time, it inherits the security and non-tampering of initial blockchain. This paper designs a new hybrid blockchain storaging mode that is Block Static Storage(BSS, internal structure is N+X hybrid blockchain, following can be referred to as N+X HBC),for purpose that improving the overall efficiency of the Internet running, achieving decentralized supervision, and provoding a credible, safe and efficient performance of the Energy Internet in the storage of its massive data, as well as a huge business system.},

  abstract={Magnetic stimulation is nowadays a standard instrument in research as well as clinical applications. But available systems still have some vital problems; these include the extreme energetic ineffectiveness and the poor flexibility of stimulation properties. In the following text we analyse a new degree of freedom for stimulation devices in the time domain. This approach owes its high potential from the simplicity to implement this feature in existing commercial systems. A similar principle has already been applied for a stimulation device long time ago, but was intentionally overdamped to mimic a monophasic system and therefore energetically meaningless. For the current work, the alternative design was implemented into a sophisticated simulation model to predict its properties. A substantial benefit is for instance the feasibility to lower the threshold of the required current within the stimulation coil for creating nervous action potentials dramatically. Accordingly, the energetic impact with its even quadratic relation to the amplitude and especially the reduction of the coil heating are remarkable. The opportunity to control the nervous reaction more precisely and to gain access to the field of more complex spiking patterns is another special attribute. The realization of the concept seems reasonably simple, whereas the impact was found to be enormous. But this shall not block the view of the fact that the discovery and the explanation needs a change of thinking about the stimulating effect of inductive stimulation.},
