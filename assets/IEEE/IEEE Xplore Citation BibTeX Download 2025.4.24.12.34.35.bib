  abstract={This study explains the development of a Web based computer aided intelligent education tool. The tool is designed to enhance the knowledge and decision making capabilities of students studying engineering related environmental issues. The system enables freshmen engineering students to enhance critical thinking ability. The power of interactive simulation, animation, artificial intelligence and object-oriented technologies are incorporated to guide the students in the decision-making processes of real-life case studies. The system developed combines theory, experiments, and software tools and can be used in classroom situations or for self/group-learning. The use of intelligent simulation modules is aimed at introductory level environmental chemistry. The currently available three modules are environmentally safe paint preparation process, automobile pollution and fundamentals of gas laws. The teaching strategy of each section of courseware is centered around a text that introduces the fundamentals, theory and links to simulated laboratories. The text also contains hyperlinks to other text pictures, audio and video resources, and interactive models.},

  abstract={Acquiring computer programming skills frequently poses difficulties for students because it necessitates analytical reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. The challenges of mastering programming syntax and debugging errors contribute to elevated dropout rates and diminished engagement. This research utilizes machine learning methodologies to forecast students' academic performance in computer programming and discern critical factors influencing their success. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was employed in two iterations of analysis involving 750 records. The initial round encompassed all 29 attributes, whereas the subsequent round concentrated on five principal attributes determined via multiple regression analysis. The research identified five principal attributes—high school GPA, self-directed learning attitude, experience with programming flowcharts, learning style preference, and career motivation—as significant predictors of learning outcomes in computer programming, attaining an accuracy of 72.40%. This allows educators to customize approaches, including the simplification of intricate subjects, the integration of experiential activities, and the provision of additional resources such as exercises and tutorials, to enhance student.},

  pages={55-59},
  abstract={Driven by intense pressures to reduce costs and become more competitive, medical imaging has reached a saddle-point of efficiency where the myriad "islands of automation" can no longer be independently managed. Given the commercial systems available today, however, no single system can meet all end-user and institutional needs. At the same time, the cost of interfaces connecting the different islands of automation can be prohibitively expensive and often is not cost-justified. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) continue to be proposed as the solution of the future, yet the concept itself is flawed in its heavy emphasis on images. Because of this emphasis, attention shifts from the more significant business and operational cost problems to viewing diagnostic images on ever more expensive equipment. This paper develops some of the key problems to be addressed while borrowing ideas from the field of factory automation. Chief among these borrowed concepts are the ideas of "process", "process control", "bottlenecks" and "capacity". In order to demonstrate the kind of paradigm shift from islands of automation to process control, an example is given of a process control-oriented user interface for a diagnostic workstation. Perhaps the shopworn and discredited PACS acronym can be retrieved with a new orientation as a diagnostic "process automation and control system".},

  abstract={The general principle of the operation of neural systems is considered, which makes clear the efficiency of information-computational structures consisting of neural-like elements. At the heart of the formulated principle lies the highly anticipated hypothesis of I.P. Pavlov that the "correctly organized" modifications of the connections between the elements and structures of the nervous system is the basis of "higher nervous activity of man" (in the terminology proposed by Pavlov). The possibility of a clear formulation of the principle, which is naturally called the Pavlov Principle (PP), arose only recently, as a result of the victorious procession of the family of computer training algorithms such as Deep Learning, which led to extremely efficient schemes for using "fine-grained" computing devices (GPU, etc.) solving cognitively complex problems. The article briefly outlines the line of development of ideas about the work of the nervous system, starting with the discovery by I.P. Pavlov of systemic conditioned reflexes, then through the neural and synaptic schemes of E. Konorsky and D. Hebb, the perceptron of F. Rosenblatt, the connectionist works of the 1980s, to modern schemes of deep learning. For the proper functioning of PP based neural networks essential is (initial) randomness of the interneuronal connections. A computational example of the solution of the model problem based on the "direct" application of the Pavlov Principle is given.},

  abstract={Nowadays employees are compelled in their workplaces to use different types of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). ICTs are frequently updated in routine work without necessarily having the means to use them effectively. This inefficiency often causes stress for both ICTs employees and users. This type of stress is generally known as Technostress and it is dealt with by professionals using strategies known under the name of Coping Strategies (CSs). When thinking about information systems we generally forget that people (ICTs users in our case) are one of its important components, which keep information systems' workflow properly working. Based on some anterior researches, this paper proposes a conceptual model to reduce Technostress starting from the triggering agents and ending with the removal or the reduction of Technostress. We conclude by obtaining the Job Satisfaction.},

  abstract={Six Sigma is an up and coming, new way of thinking that strives for as close to perfection as possible. A Six Sigma approach can be applied to numerous aspects of life from computer science to businesses, and in this paper, we will explore how implementing a Six Sigma approach to a business can affect it. One of the first things we will investigate is how Six Sigma in business varies from how it is used in other fields. Once we understand this, we can dive into the various niches that it can apply to businesses. Some of these things are how it will help reduce waste and increase profits for a business. Expanding on this, we will also consider how implementing a new business practice such as a Six Sigma model could affect employee morale. We anticipate that due to a better business environment that something like this could improve, however it will be expanded upon further later in this research paper. Additionally, the last thing we would like to investigate involving Six Sigma in business is how it can change the quality of that business's goods or services. In this paper we will continue to investigate and research the previously stated research topics regarding Six Sigma in business. We will find out whether it is an effective approach and will be using how it affects waste, productivity, morale, and quality, to make an assessment.},

  abstract={We live in a complex world where uncertainty is the only certainty. Today's compelling business problem is replaced tomorrow with a problem which was not even imagined yesterday. Data driven decision systems are used by managers in support of their strategic decisions and should be agile and flexibility to survive in our ever change world of complex decisions. The argument presented in this conceptual paper is that data vault modeling is inherently better equipped than dimensional modelling to handle the turbulations of our complex world. The paper investigates the underlying assumptions of dimensional modelling and data vault modelling in terms of requirements collection and the resulting data modelling techniques. It uses critical systems thinking as guiding philosophy to reflect on the benefits of understanding and modelling a variety of perspectives in a problem situation. Critical systems thinking also promotes equal opportunity and accountability. It is argued that both these aspirations can better be achieved by using dimensional modeling as alternative to dimensional modelling. We hope to promote the development of sustainable data driven decision systems which can stand the test of our turbulent times.},

  abstract={Educational institutions worldwide continue to improve their teaching and learning activities in almost all the facets of the profession. Upon the declaration of COVID 19 as a pandemic, learning activities were abruptly shifted from the in-person to virtual classroom activities. The transition required changes in the strategies and methods/styles of teaching. Despite the success in most of the activities, classroom interactions and assessments of students' work emerged as areas that deserve more attention. The objective of this study is to develop a pilot project aimed at maintaining acceptable and secured levels of interactions and assessments. The setting for this study includes virtual classroom interactions, peer level tutoring sessions, and formative assessments. To improve the interactions, efficacious assessment methods deploying incremental levels of thinking were used. This requires a third-party program for embedding questions on prerecorded lectures. The questions were then randomized and assigned to the subjects. The use of hierarchical randomization of multiple-choice questions for the short quizzes resulted in reduction of cheating. The performance of the students in the four sections of a calculus course used for this project improved by 17%. For complete eradication of cheating, the midterm was returned from online back to the traditional classrooms. Such move will include the final exam in mid-December.},

  abstract={The processing of dynamical systems from everyday life requires the development of system thinking and the record of mathematical relations between variables, which is known as mathematical modelling. The dilemma that appears is how to develop the system thinking and particularly mathematical modelling in schools at earlier ages. In order to discuss dynamical systems, the basic knowledge of differential equations is necessary. Therefore, mathematical modelling appears to be applicable only to students. The article represents a possible processing of dynamical systems with graphic oriented computer programmes, e.g. Berkeley Madonna, Daynasys and Stella in primary schools. The programme packages enable the pupils to construct a given system by linking together different graphical objects for parameters, variables, and fluxes of variables. Some actual examples (liquid flow) of the dynamical systems which can be used in primary schools will be shown in the article. In advance the examples of the liquid flows are linked to simple mathematical models which illustrate the object movement influenced by forces. We lay a particular emphasis on a simple mathematical model for free-falling objects in the air since this topic has already been taught at physics in primary schools.},

  abstract={In our software-defined radio project, we aim at combining two standards luetooth and HIPERLAN/2. The HIPERLAN/2 receiver requires more computational power than Bluetooth. We choose to use this computational power also for Bluetooth and look for more advanced demodulation algorithms such as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) receiver. The paper discusses a simplified MAP receiver for Bluetooth GFSK signals. Laurent decomposition provides an orthogonal vector space for the MAP receiver. As the first Laurent waveform contains the most energy, we have used only this waveform for our (simplified) MAP receiver. This receiver requires a E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of about 11 dB for a BER of 10/sup -3/, required by the Bluetooth standard. This value is about 6 dB better than single bit demodulators. This performance is only met if the receiver has exact knowledge of the modulation index.},

  abstract={The complexity of medical problem solving presents a formidable challenge to current theories of cognition. Building on earlier work, we claim that the systemslevel cognitive model LIDA (for “Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent”) offers a number of specific advantages for modeling diagnostic thinking. The LIDA Model employs a consciousness mechanism in an iterative cognitive cycle of understanding, attention, and action, endowing it with the ability to integrate multiple sensory modalities into flexible, dynamic, multimodal representations according to strategies that support specific task demands. These representations enable diverse, asynchronous cognitive processes to be dynamically activated according to rapidly changing contexts, much like in biological cognition. The recent completion of the LIDA Framework, a software API supporting the domain-independent LIDA Model, allows the construction of domain-specific agents that test the Model and/or enhance traditional machine learning algorithms with human-style problem solving. Medical Agent X (MAX) is a medical diagnosis agent under development using the LIDA Model and Framework. We review LIDA's approach to exploring cognition, assert its appropriateness for problem solving in complex domains such as diagnosis, and outline the design of an initial implementation for MAX.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The importance of dialogue in questioning assumptions and bringing new options and perspectives to light is well established in various areas of decision-making; what potential does it hold to enrich students' critical thinking competencies in the context of ethics education? We examine student work in an ethics course for senior computer science and software engineering students. The course includes a series of exercises in critical ethical inquiry, implementing the iterative Ethical Cycle approach of van de Poel and Royakkers with reflection sessions where students exchange peer critiques. Through a qualitative analysis of two years of student work, we explore two questions: what kinds of critical issues do students acknowledge in peer dialogue, and how do students incorporate, or fail to incorporate, critical challenges into their work? We identify and categorize critical challenges that appear in student reflection statements, and we identify a number of patterns of critical engagement: ways in which student map the identifications of critical challenges to subsequent changes in later iterations. Our results indicate that dialogue with others is generally an enriching component of students' ethical inquiry, though not all students take advantage of it even when built into class exercises, and other students may adopt new ideas in a superficial way, failing to truly incorporate them into prior discussion. The results also suggest certain design changes of the ethical analysis exercises that can help students take greater advantage of insights from their peers: fostering greater interplay between peers through a single clearly identified topic; more defined scaffolding of peer discussions, prompting students to identify critical challenges from others; further scaffolding to remind students of the peer challenges raised earlier and ask them how (and whether) they wish to incorporate these new perspectives into their own work; and more discussion and modeling of how to truly incorporate new ideas in a robust way.},

The purpose of such automation can be the development of intellectual assistants in various spheres of activity. The intellectual assistant in prospect can partially or completely replace the sales manager, conducting argumentative dialog with the client in automatic or semi-automatic mode. Also, as an application of methods for automating human reasoning can be the development of a digital consultant, which selects for the manager the possible options of proposals that can satisfy the customer. The manager then selects the most suitable options from his point of view, offers them to the customer and explains why these options will suit the customer. We continue to develop a model-theoretic approach to the formalization of thinking, reasoning, consciousness, and reflection based on the application of the Partial Model Theory. In this paper, we formalize and model purposeful reasoning aimed at solving the problem of achieving the “ideal final result” required by the client. For this purpose, we construct a sequence of partial models, each of which is a supermodel of the previous one, specifying the client's requirements to the desired result. In order to model purposeful reasoning, concepts and representations are formalized. In such a way, formalization and modeling of conceptual reasoning aimed at achieving a given result is performed.},

  abstract={The growing concern about offshore chip manufacturing has created considerable interest in solutions that can ensure the integrity and security of chips. Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245× higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.},

  title={Modeling Learners to Early Predict Their Performance in Educational Computer Games}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={20399-20417},
  abstract={Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem, inspired by the Think-Like-A-Vertex (TLAV) paradigm. The Vertex Cover problem, a fundamental challenge in graph theory, finds significant relevance in the context of the compute continuum, where the optimal placement of application images across a diverse range of computational resources is a critical concern. Our proposed TLAV-based algorithm addresses this challenge by leveraging local information at each vertex to make intelligent decisions, thereby reducing the global complexity of the problem. While this approach could potentially lead to resource overprovisioning, we argue that in the context of the compute continuum, this trade-off can provide more flexibility and redundancy, enhancing the reliability of the system. Through extensive analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on large-scale graphs, making a significant contribution to the field of resource management in the compute continuum.},

  pages={3-12},
  abstract={Recent researches reveal that various paradigms of intelligence, such as natural, artificial, machinable, and computational intelligence, can be unified at the logical and functional levels known as abstract intelligence. This paper introduces abstract intelligence as a form of driving force that transfers information into knowledge and behaviors. An architectural framework of abstract intelligence and the Generic Abstract Intelligence Mode (GAIM) are formally developed that provide a unified theory for explaining the mechanisms of advanced intelligence. In order to deal with the highly complex and abstract objects in abstract intelligence, denotational mathematics is introduced as a category of expressive mathematical structures for modeling and manipulating high-level mathematical entities beyond numbers and sets, such as abstract objects, complex relations, behavioral information, abstract concepts, knowledge, processes, and systems. Applications of denotational mathematics in abstract intelligence, cognitive informatics, and computational intelligence are elaborated.},

  abstract={In this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and ChatGPT was analyzed. The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Imagination is the fundamental of creating something new. Humans can invent things if they can imagine that. So human imagination is the base of all evolution including science and technology. Humans produce their imagination from what they think, hear and see. Artificial imagination is the imagination of a machine which is produced by training a lot of data. Unsupervised learning technique gives the opportunity of learning from data by producing different patterns. It is also a concern of increasing realistic imagination in terms of implementation of artificial imagination like human imagination. This paper aims to review the relationship between artificial imagination and human imagination alongside the overview of implementing artificial imagination using modern machine learning algorithms. We tried to overview all the aspects of human imagination and reviewed their implementation. We also consider the drawbacks of combining human imagination with artificial imagination in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.},
