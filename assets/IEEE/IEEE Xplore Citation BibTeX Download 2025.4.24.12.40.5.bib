  abstract={This chapter provides specific details regarding the concerns of the founders of what is now the science of systems or systemics, in order to understand the stakes that still remain extremely relevant today. It proposes to revisit the key event system sciences, or systemics originated, in which the mathematician Norbert Wiener, professor at MIT, has been an emblematic actor. Cybernetics pertains to time‐related actions that are carried out in an unstable environment. In the 1990s–2000s, it became obvious that what the pioneers N. Wiener, J. von Neumann and A. Turing had imagined was beginning to turn into reality. Of the three, only N. Wiener perhaps knew about transistors. Today, we have all the technology to provide good systemics. The chapter provides a brief view of the chronology and the main changes in teaching systems science at MIT.},

  abstract={People nowadays cannot think of even a single moment without the internet. Doubtlessly, web applications are currently the key to all change in the world. The features and facilities of web applications make our lives easier and also demonstrate different channels of communication and exchange of data. The number of internet user is increasing day by day in Bangladesh. Web applications are not only encouraging internet users to easily receive diversified services, but also creating new opportunities in every business sector. With the help of web applications, businesses can easily enhance the quality of their services to consumers with minimal effort. However, at the same time, many threats have arisen as a result of the misuse of this technology. Cyber attacks could emerge as a major threat to the digital transformation of Bangladesh, given the vulnerability in web applications caused by careless coding during the development of such applications. During our review, we observed that the existence of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the web applications of Bangladesh was very critical. This paper explores in detail the harmful web application vulnerability attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on Remote File Inclusion (RFI) as well as Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi), and their impact on the applications of Bangladesh.},

But it is heavy for operator to define how to give teaching signals generally because operator must guess and think of a task and environment and define a function to do that. Here the author aim to create teaching signals automatically for each task and environment. In this paper, the author suggest a simple rule which is independent of information about any task and environment to create teaching signals for each task and environment. This rule is that a situation which is often happened is good situation. In this paper, the author adopt reinforcement learning as learning method and a small-sized humanoid robot as application.

  abstract={It is very difficult for students who do not have a business career or experience to understand business models or structures. In addition, business models from the student viewpoint remain largely within a model-based understanding, and students do not have practical opportunities to create an image of business uncertainty. Our goal is to provide an experimental learning environment beyond the level of the students' hypothetical thinking about uncertainty in business. We have developed a versatile participatory simulation environment as an active learning environment for the university classroom. We apply a multiagent-based approach to represent the uncertainty of the business environment. This paper introduces one of our active learning programs, the Croquette Factory Game, for understanding business interaction with uncertainty. We show that this program provides beneficial educational effects for students in understanding a business model with uncertainty.},

  abstract={What is it that differentiates man and puts him on the throne of the entire animal kingdom? Yes, it's the human brain, and not the human, which is the most valuable creation of God. But the brain, all its knowledge and power are destroyed after the death of man. Is it possible to model a brain and upload the contents of the real natural brain into it thereby propagating life even after death? Yes, indeed. Today, organ donation is giving a new lease of life to many ailing patients, however can brain be added to the list of organs that can be donated? Imagine the marvels that would be back into existence if we could replicate and restore the brains of geniuses like Sir Albert Einstein or Newton or even our great leaders of the past like Mahatma Gandhi. This paper presents a literature survey on the Blue Brain technology that promptly answers all these sparkling questions. Scientists today are in research to take artificial intelligence to a level beyond everything, to create a virtual brain that could think, react, make decisions and also keep everything in some form of memory to do everything that a normal human brain can. To achieve this, the main approach is to upload an actual brain in a virtual brain. So that even after death the person's conscience would be able to function exactly as a normal brain in the form of a machine. IBM along with scientists at BMI (Brain and Mind Institute) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Research University in Switzerland are simulating the brain's biological systems into a 3D model, which would recreate the electrochemical interactions that take place inside the brain. If this simulation results in a success, the modeling would extend to different parts of the brain and make it function with all the abilities of a natural brain, thereby eliminating the chances of any brain malfunctions such as psychiatric disorders like depression and autism, which are possible in the normal brain. IBM names this project as the 'Blue Brain' project.},

  abstract={For unable to establish geometrical relationship of coordinates, conventional methods of 3D shape recovery can not be adopted to a great number of precious historical images to recover the 3D shape of the objects and environments in the images. The new method of 3D shape recovery based on single frame historical image is proposed in this paper. The core idea of this research is that, according to the change of the shade of gray of each pixel, the tilt angle and slant angle of the surface vertical vector of each object's pixel in the image is analyzed, then the depth of each pixel is calculated in response to the tilt angle and slant angle. Simulating human being's vision system and the process of thinking of brain, this method makes the process of man's 3D comprehension of single image computerize to obtain 3D digitized data. These 3D digitized data can be used in the fields of the 3D recovery of historical relics and the identification of 3D portrait and stereo literal.},

  abstract={The statement “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” was printed in the Harvard Business Review about 10 years ago. Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) have become widespread and have been utilized in research and real world applications. We sometimes get consultations such as, “Please teach me about AI,” “I want to use deep learning in my business,” or “I want data mining to do a good job of analysis. What should researchers do? In response to these consultations, I will discuss three issues: 1) problems in which the data are available but cannot be used immediately (preprocessing issues), 2) problems in which the results are difficult to explain in an easy-to-understand manner (explainable AI), and 3) problems in which the purpose of data analysis has not been identified. First, I consider the topic “when we receive a consultation, there is a lot of data, but it is not ready for use.” This is a case in which the “data ready” stage identified by the researcher is different from the “data ready” stage identified by a general person. The second topic considers the following problem “the results presented by researchers are difficult for a general person to understand.” The researcher's explanations of the algorithm and its results are very difficult. A general person is unable to judge the data analysis result from the viewpoint of “is it useful for business?” The last topic is the most difficult; A general person vaguely thinks that “AI can do something,” but “something” does not allow researchers to identify issues. I will discuss the relationship between research and practical use and what can be done from an academic standpoint.},

Agile places a strong emphasis on interaction and communication with each other, whether this is outside the team, but especially within the team, there are many different possibilities.},

  abstract={Online advertising has emerged as one of the major business models on the Internet. Publishers rely on the online revenue generated from online advertising to offer their free services. At the same time, intrusive ads such as pop-ups and animated layer ads are being perceived as annoying thing by an increasing number of Web users, because they distract the Web users from reading or navigating through the main content of web pages. It is definitely not a problem to place ads within Web pages as long as they do not become annoying. Thinking from the perspective of most users, online advertising should have a limit. It is necessary to model the intrusiveness of online advertising in order to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between user experiences and branding effectiveness. In this paper, an approach based on neural network is proposed to model the intrusiveness of online advertising. Comprehensive features of ads and hosting Web pages are exploited and effectively combined. Promising experimental results are obtained on Web pages collected from 500 Web sites.},

  abstract={This paper intent to make a interdisciplinary studies on product creation and communication theories. In the light of the principle of diffusion of Innovation in developing communication theories, it interprets relevant is sues about product innovation with a revolutionary new perspective and sets up diffusion model to bring enlightenment on this topic. In contrast to traditional innovation thinking, this is more than a procedure, and much easier for product designer to hold. Therefore to explore the issue of product innovation is important to diffusion.},
