  abstract={Quantum mechanics is a revolutionary scientific field, which lies at the crossroad section of Physics, Mathematics, Computer and Computational Science. In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.},

  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, has introduced both new opportunities and challenges in STEM and entrepreneurship education. This exploratory quasi-experimental study examined the effects of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning on students' learning performance, AI awareness, critical thinking, and cognitive load. 36 sophomore undergraduates participated in an eight-week instructional experiment, dedicating 3 hours per week to applying STEM and entrepreneurship knowledge in the creation of cultural products. The experimental group (N = 21) participated in ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (CCL), while the control group (N = 15) engaged in Non-ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (NCCL). The results indicated that the CCL group outperformed the NCCL group in terms of learning performance, AI awareness, and cognitive load, while the NCCL group excelled in critical thinking. The findings confirm that ChatGPT offers significant potential and advantages in addressing complex problems within group collaboration and stimulating group creativity, providing new insights into fostering students' entrepreneurial spirit and skills. However, over-reliance on and misuse of ChatGPT may hinder student learning outcomes. Future research should focus on the co-creative problem-solving mechanisms between humans and machines in entrepreneurial education, particularly the interplay of knowledge, thinking, emotions, and actions in collaborative processes involving generative artificial intelligence.},

  year={2019},
  volume={62},
  number={4},
  pages={325-332},
  abstract={Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a new model of artificial cognitive architecture for intelligent systems, the Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture (NEUCOGAR). The model is bio mimetically inspired and adapts the neuromodulators role of human brains into computational environments. This way we aim at achieving more efficient Artificial Intelligence solutions based on the biological inspiration of the deep functioning of human brain, which is highly emotional. The analysis of new data obtained from neurology, psychology philosophy and anthropology allows us to generate a mapping of monoamine neuro modulators and to apply it to computational system parameters. Artificial cognitive systems can then better perform complex tasks (regarding information selection and discrimination, attention, innovation, creativity) as well as engaging in affordable emotional relationships with human users.},

  abstract={This work in progress paper in the research-to-practice category focuses on high school students planning to enter a new learning environment for transition. Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.},

  abstract={Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution. The advancement of deep learning algorithms can potentially help improve lung cancer detection with low-dose CT scans.},

  abstract={This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Recent technological advancements are revolutionizing the field of pathology as the practice adopts digital workflows and computational tools to augment the analysis of tissue and enhance its role in patient care. These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level. In addition, standard didactic courses struggle to keep with the rapid pace of advancements driving the field, build the essential multidisciplinary teamwork skills, train the technical skillsets required for success, or emphasize innovation. Structured experiential learning (EL) has a long track record of success in addressing these issues and presents as a natural modality for early CPATH education. We have designed and piloted a project based EL course targeted towards undergraduates to address these limitations in CPATH education. At the core of the course experience, students work together to conceptualize, design, and implement innovative solutions to leverage CPATH towards addressing global health inequity. Here we present our design of the course, review insights from our first two years of piloting this course and share plans for course improvement drawn from these insights.Clinical relevance— CPATH is making a significant impact on the practice of pathology and is poised to play a major role in addressing global health inequities. This course is designed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to innovate in this rapidly growing and developing field as members of multidisciplinary teams through structured project based EL. While open to students at the undergraduate and master’s level from all backgrounds, it is directed at undergraduate biomedical engineering, computer science, and pre medicine students who are interested in future careers in this field.},

The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.},

  abstract={While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

  abstract={Game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to enhance engagement, comprehension of course material, and academic achievements. This study aims to investigate previous studies on integrating computational thinking (CT) abilities in STEM education through GBL and propose a framework for integrating CT through the GBL framework. The proposed framework focuses on certain domains in creating mobile gaming content that facilitates the user's acquisition of knowledge about the advancement of CT in science, specifically within the STEM discipline. In addition, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify a specific research need. In the proposed framework, this study emphasized more that CT is implemented as an approach to attract the involvement of students in STEM education through the framework. To foster more engagement, the development of CT should consider STEM-appropriate components of the framework by optimizing software and hardware functions.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been dubbed as a fundamental skill for the 21st century and can be learned by all. However, little research exists on the practical use of CT in daily life. Therefore, this problem was addressed by applying a design science research approach and situational method engineering to propose an artefact that can help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the problem-solving process using CT and the Work System Method (WSM). The resulting artefact offers a systematic way of problem-solving process and allows SMEs to discover process innovation. The study has considerable implications for business owners and IS researchers. The business owner can improve the efficiency of their business process and increase the company's productivity.},
