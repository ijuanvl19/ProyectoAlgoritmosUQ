  abstract={Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems, and for testing algorithms through simulations that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to implement. A model has been devised that simulates the sound localization performance of normal hearing persons, and that is being further refined for simulation of performance of hearing-impaired persons wearing two cochlear implants (CIs). The model is intended to be a tool in understanding the relative contribution of various factors involved in acoustic localization, and in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies. This presentation overviews the development of and results for the normal hearing model, and discusses modifications that are needed to simulate sound processing with binaural cochlear implants. The human head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of the model, and provides the characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects. It defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues reaching each ear that are important for good localization ability. The model has been validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization in normal listeners, and is being further developed to account for differences in the signal pathway and sound reaching the CI user due to sound processing and microphone location effects.},

  abstract={Today digital media such as social networks, chat rooms, and forums have gained much importance in human life for information sharing. Users will share their knowledge and emotions in their own languages. This will create a novel syntax to communicate their messages with as much as pithiness as possible. Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.},

  abstract={World Wide Web is a dynamic source of information which is expanding its content at a staggering rate. Individual search engines are not able to handle the exponential nature of Web. Hence meta-search engines are used to solve the problem of low web space information coverage rate of individual search engines. A meta-search engine is a kind of search tool that dynamically dispatches user query to the underlying search engines, hence providing parallel access to multiple search engines and then aggregate the results to present single consolidated result list to user. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, MetaFusion, has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines fuzzy AHP with genetic algorithm to get more comprehensive and optimized results. Experimental results shows that relevancy of results returned by MetaFusion is more than several existing research Metasearch engines. The precision of MetaFusion is more when compared with Dogpile and Infospace.},

An old wish of engineers is to have a highly integrated system for the handling of all necessary information during the entire lifecycle of an industrial product. Development of modeling and simulation based product lifecycle management (PLM) systems grounded the realization of such a system during the first decade of this century. The next step is to fill these systems with content in which practice, skill, experience, and intelligence of engineers are represented at a minimum level for successful understanding of a product model in absence of the humans who defined that content. The authors published some results in this topic area in recent years. In this paper, they describe some new methodological elements in order to achieve better representation capability of their earlier proposed modeling. They characterize intelligence in modeled content, explain indirect method for mapping of knowledge at object definition, and discuss expertise and knowledge sources for product model.},

  abstract={More and more digital supports are being developed to assist creativity. Some of them are designed to uniquely support specific creative methods, while others target the overall support of the creativity and innovation process. Whatever they might offer, only a few use a systems engineering approach. Generally, they do not formalize the environment or interactions within it. The present study proposes a new formalism for modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will discuss CSS support of the “48h to Generate Ideas®” creativity challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is revolutionizing medical information access and professional advice delivery. This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies. Results showed that the Qwen-VL-Mediacal model achieved a Rouge-1 score of 0.6147, indicating its potential for medical applications. However, challenges remain, such as understanding complex scenes and abstract concepts. Future research will aim to improve the model's adaptability and reasoning capabilities.},

  pages={171-174},
  abstract={Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges for primary and secondary teacher capacity development. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher’ s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.},

  abstract={The research aims to conduct a psychophysical experiment to explore the subjective emotion perception of the observers under white light sources with different illuminance, correlated color temperature (CCT), and distance to the black-body locus (Duv). Based on the experimental results, appropriate lighting conditions will be derived, and an evaluation model is established for beauty and aromatherapy to assess emotion perception under different white light sources based on the large amount of data obtained from the experiment.},

  abstract={Process algebra have been effectively exploited for modeling and verifying functional aspects of services composition, but non-functional aspects have not been given enough care due to process algebra lacking of capability of modeling them. In this paper, we propose a novel process algebra called PTPA that incorporates price and cost. We present syntax and semantics of PTPA. And an algorithm is proposed to construct cost state space that is used to select web services composition with optimal cost. Case analysis show that PTPA can model both functional aspects and non-functional aspects of services composition.},

  abstract={3D printing is a contemporary method of three-dimensional objects’ production. Prior to the printing, the object must be designed in the form of its 3D model - a virtual spatial body. The model is then transferred into a computer program which will control the printing process. Finally, the object is composed using a stepwise addition of micro-particles (grains).3D printing is very appropriate for the individualized production i.e. for fabricating unique objects or those done in small series. A typical lifecycle of these objects is "Design it – Produce it – Make use of it". A growing interest in this extent of production requires preparing enough 3D-printing specialists in a variety disciplines. In our presentation, we discuss what professionals are needed and what modifications of contemporary schooling would fulfil these requirements to a maximum degree.},
