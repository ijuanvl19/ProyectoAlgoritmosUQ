  pages={1456-1461},
  abstract={Evaluating teacher performance is essential for enhancing educational quality, but accurately estimating the performance is very challenging due to the complexity and subjectivity of the assessment criteria. It is a good real-time problem where optimization algorithms have utmost application. This paper investigates the use of metaheuristic algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the Firefly Algorithm (FA) and proposed HybPSO-FA approach, to estimate the teacher performance. By combining the strengths of both PSO and Firefly algorithms, the hybrid technique aims to optimize performance estimation while minimizing computational complexity. The results of the proposed method indicate that the hybrid algorithm significantly outperforms the standalone methods in terms of achieving the optimal value for teacher performance evaluation and convergence speed. This study highlights the potential of using hybrid optimization techniques for performance evaluation in academics having various criteria, making them more reliable and efficient for use in educational institutions.},

  abstract={Suicide remains a pressing public health concern worldwide, necessitating effective predictive and preventive strategies. Predicting suicidal tendencies is a complex endeavor, as it involves multifaceted interactions between biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Advances in computational modeling and machine learning have provided promising avenues for understanding and forecasting these tendencies. Such models often integrate clinical data, including psychiatric history, symptom severity, and demographic information, with biological markers and psychosocial variables. The objective of our work is to identify patterns and risk factors that may indicate heightened suicidal risk. Ongoing research seeks to refine predictive models, incorporate real-time monitoring, and develop targeted interventions, aiming to reduce the incidence of suicide and provide timely support to those at risk. The application of suicide text analysis extends to user-friendly interfaces, allowing individuals to input text, receive predictions, and access relevant support. The analysis involves preprocessing techniques such as text normalization, stop-word removal, and stemming to enhance the quality of input data. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from Naive Bayes to sophisticated ensemble methods, are explored to determine their effectiveness in predicting suicidal ideation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={63484-63503},
  abstract={The emerging Human-Centric Networks (HCN) paradigm shifts the passive role of individuals to an active one, intertwining the uncertainty of network resource usage with human dynamics, which are difficult to analyze and predict. This phenomenon implies an increase in reciprocal interactions between Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and human activities, presenting the challenge of efficiently allocating network resources while taking into account qualitative human uncertainty. In this study, we propose a conceptual model that addresses and quantifies such uncertainties. The proposed model is characterized by its adaptability to various CPSS applications, facilitating its integration into existing applications and future innovations. The adaptability of the model is based on the application of the sociological concept of Boundary Objects (BO), which allows for the structuring of system components and the generation of a reference architecture that facilitates systematic problem solving. To evaluate the model, we propose a use case related to a Vehicle for Hire (VFH) application operating within a 5G network slice. The integration of the proposed model with the OMNET++ simulation framework has allowed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in intricate computational environments and have shown its capacity to incorporate previously overlooked elements that are essential for the optimal allocation of resources in CPSS. This study proposes a methodology for comprehending and mitigating the consequences of human uncertainty, emphasizing the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to resource allocation in sophisticated technological systems.},

  abstract={With the development of human science and technology, applications of computer are more and more comprehensive. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to drawing, thinking, and problem solving becomes a significant topic. Recently, research on automatic composition using AI technology and especially evolutionary algorithms is blooming and has received promising results. A common issue at the current evolutionary composition systems is their requirement for subjective feedback of human sensation as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts. These weights obtained can interpret the music style and render an objective measure of compositions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve satisfactory compositions.},

  title={Speeding up Large-Scale Financial Recomputation with Memoization}, 
  year={2014},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={17-22},
  abstract={Quantitative financial analysis requires repeated computations of the same functions with the same arguments when prototyping trading strategies; many of these functions involve resource intensive operations on large matrices. Reducing the number of repeated computations either within a program or across runs of the same program would allow analysts to build and debug trading strategies more quickly. We built a disk memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. Anymemoization solution should be easy to use, minimizing the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate, while at the same time giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space used for caching. Guo and Engler proposed a similar tool that does automatic memoization by modifying the python interpreter, while the packages Jug and Joblib are distributed computing tools that have memoization options. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of the above packages for memoization, but at the same time give a higher degree of control of how caching is done for users who need it. We provide the same basic features as these other libraries, but allow control of how hashing is done, space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking. This should lead to both increased productivity and speed increases for recomputation. We show that for several financial calculations, including Markowitz Optimization, Fama French, and the Singular Value Decomposition, memoization greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99%. We also show that by using xxhash, a non-cryptographic hash function, instead of md5, and avoiding equality checks, our package greatly outperforms joblib, the best current package.},

  abstract={Portfolio management consists of deciding what assets to include in a portfolio given the investor's objectives and changing market and economic conditions. The always difficult selection process includes identifying which assets to purchase, how much, and when. This paper presents a novel memetic neuro-fuzzy system for financial portfolio management (MNFS-FPM) which emulates the thinking process of a rational investor and generates the optimal portfolio from a collection of assets based on a chosen investment style. The system consists mainly of two modules: the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network realizing Yager inference (GenSoFNN-Yager), to predict the expected return of each asset, and a memetic algorithm using simplex local searches (MA-NM/SMD) to determine the optimal investment weight allocation for all assets in the portfolio. Experimental results on Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) stocks show that the proposed system yields better performance compared to that of existing financial models: statistical mean-variance analysis and capital asset pricing model (CAPM).},

  abstract={In this paper, a design model that regards an interactive application as a set of processes is described. Each process can be specified using the IMPG (Interactive Multi Flow Graph) model, a process model that combines Petri Net models properties with users' cognitive aspects. In this way, several perspectives of interactive applications are offered to designers; these are behavioral, informational, causal and contextual. IMFG is used as the specification model of a graphical tool that supports the design of interactive applications as the continuous refinement of users' goals, thus forcing designers to "think in users' terms". The strongest feature of IMFG is that it can be adapted to every domain of interactive applications. As an example, the model application to the design of the user interface of a highly-interactive authoring environment is briefly presented.<>},

  abstract={Most HPC clusters are now based on an x86 architecture and Linux. In a Grid consisting of such clusters, users might think that a single executable file, a data set, and a single job script will work in all cluster environments. However, due to the lack of interoperability of MPI library implementations, file systems, and batch job systems, users need to be conscious of the runtime environments over the Grid. In order to overcome such differences, we propose a runtime environment called Xruntime consisting of the following three components. MPI-Adapter is middleware between the user program and an MPI implementation to make it possible to execute a single executable code on different MPI implementations. Catwalk is transparent file staging middleware that makes remote files accessed by an application visible as if they were located in the local system. Xruntime allows a user to use various clusters with single batch job script language the user is familiar with, without learning other batch job script languages used on other clusters.},

  abstract={Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.},

  pages={3355-3367},
  abstract={In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.},

  abstract={We are at the dawn of a new area of AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), which holds the potential to automate and generate in ways never before possible and can be applied across countless disciplines from natural language processing (NLP) to image synthesis, interactive simulations, and more. Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks and transformers, as well as cutting edge AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, DALL-E, Gemini, and Bing Copilot have made content generation a different game. From realizing intelligent code generation, realistic image synthesis, or personalized search, these tools are transforming industries to software development and digital art, to search engines. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of generative AI technologies and the methodologies behind these technologies, including attention mechanisms, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformer-based models such as GPT and BERT. The paper also discusses the implementation of generative AI across Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, highlighting how the use of AI to generate content is revolutionizing the interactive experiences in gaming, education, and training. In the study we also perform performance evaluations of generative AI models on benchmark datasets using BLEU, ROUGE scores etc. We discuss some of the challenges facing generative AI on ethical, computational, and too-often opaque lines and predict that generative AI can transform industries by creating autonomous creativity and personalized learning.},

  abstract={Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has always been an important research topic for applying artificial intelligence in smart healthcare. Sufficient medical data are one of the most critical factors in CAD research. However, medical data are usually obtained in chronological order and cannot be collected all at once, which poses difficulties for the application of deep learning technology in the medical field. The traditional batch learning method consumes considerable time and space resources for real-time medical data, and the incremental learning method often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time medical data processing method based on federated learning. We divide the process into the model stage and the exemplar stage. In the model stage, we use the federated learning method to fuse the old and new models to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. In the exemplar stage, we use the most representative exemplars selected from the old data to help the new model review the old knowledge, which further mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. We use this method to conduct experiments on a simulated medical real-time data stream. The experimental results show that our method can learn a disease diagnosis model from a continuous medical real-time data stream. As the amount of data increases, the performance of the disease diagnosis model continues to improve, and the catastrophic forgetting problem has been effectively mitigated. Compared with the traditional batch learning method, our method can significantly save time and space resources.},

  abstract={We investigate the use of emotional agents in the decision-making process of a mobile robot. We propose a fuzzy logic model that captures the inherent uncertainty of emotions. The model is used to generate decisions based on both internal and external states and incorporates the use of sensory information to extract environmental conditions. In this way, the agent will react to a changing environment and can take an action according to a mixture of emotions generated by multiple states. As a first step towards addressing the complexity, the model deals with three negative emotions-fear, pain and anger-chosen because of their innate structure. In this paper, we discuss our fuzzy logic model and describe the implementation of an emotional agent on a small mobile robot in which sensory information is used to generate emotions.},

  abstract={The curse of dimensionality is a well-established phenomenon. However, the properties of high dimensional data are often poorly understood and overlooked during the process of data modelling and analysis. Similarly, how to optimally fuse different modalities is still a big research question. In this paper, we addressed these challenges by proposing a novel two level brain-inspired compression based optimised multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition. In the first level, the framework extracts the compressed and optimised multimodal features by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based compression on each modality (i.e. audio, text, and visuals). The second level simply concatenates the extracted optimised and compressed features for classification. The performance of the proposed approach with two different compression levels (i.e. 78% and 98%) is compared with late fusion (class level-1 dimension, class probabilities level-4 dimension) and early fusion (feature level-72000 dimension). The simulation results and critical analysis have demonstrated up to 10% and 5% performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) based multimodal emotion recognition systems respectively. We hypothesise that there exist an optimal level of compression at which optimised multimodal features could be extracted from each modality, which could lead to a significant performance improvement.},

  abstract={We provide a proof of principle that novel and engaging mobile casual games with new aesthetics, game mechanics and player interactions can be designed and tested directly on the device for which they are intended. We describe the Gamika iOS application which includes generative art assets; a design interface enabling the making of physics-based casual games containing multiple levels with aspects ranging from Frogger-like to Asteroids-like and beyond; a configurable automated playtester which can give feedback on the playability of levels; and an automated fine-tuning engine which searches for level parameterisations that enable the game to pass a battery of tests, as evaluated by the auto-playtester. Each aspect of the implementation represents a baseline with much room for improvement, and we present some experimental results and describe how these will guide the future directions for Gamika.},

  abstract={Identifiers are an essential component of online communication. My research focuses on the ways that social, technical and policy factors affect people's behavior with online identifiers. For example, my research demonstrates that people separate both business and professional roles by communicating with separate identifiers. People may have different identifiers for technical reasons, such as difficulties in configuring settings. In addition, corporate security policies place restrictions on people's communications which influences the way people manage identifiers. I conducted a series of in-depth interviews with two groups sampled from different populations.},

  title={Reconstructing Critical Paths from Execution Traces}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={524-531},
  abstract={We consider the problem of constructing critical paths from incomplete information. In general, a directed acyclic graph of tasks with their execution times (i.e., a task graph) is necessary to extract critical paths. We assume, however, that only the set of tasks, and their start and end times are known, e.g., an execution trace in the form of a Gantt chart. This information can be extracted from real machines or from the output of analysis tools, whereas extraction of the exact task graph often is problematic due to imperative modeling formalisms and complicated platform semantics (resource allocation, varying execution speeds). We show that, based on start and end times only, an over- approximation of the critical paths of an unknown task graph can be extracted nevertheless. Furthermore, this approach is generalized to deal with "noisy" execution traces of real machines in which control overhead is present. Finally, we discuss various methods to deal with false positives, and apply our approach to a complex industrial case study.},

  abstract={Today, the advancement in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) pave the way for establishing a simulated three-dimensional world for educational purpose and interactive learning. AR technology witness an increasing usage in recent years in the learning process of several areas of knowledge. However, using AR in education is still a big challenge and limited. There are certain constrains linked to the perception of learners to use AR as well as it is unclear to what extent this technology improves the spatial performance of learners in certain academics. Another question this study tries to answer, why AR is more effective than VR in preserving knowledge in learners’ minds. The purpose of this paper is to review the most important theories and reports on AR in education, and its connection to human spatial memory. The review of literature reveals that VR is an efficient technology and provide good tools for spatial memory research, but it still not compared with respect to spatial performance with AR. The significant impact of AR on learning ability of student is high by creating a sustainable and immersive education environment which enhance students’ spatial memory, especially in academic fields that are based on visual topics.},

  title={An Analysis of Software Supportable Tasks Related with ISO/IEC 15408}, 
  year={2013},

  pages={601-606},
  abstract={From the perspective of information security engineering, ISO/IEC 15408, one of ISO/IEC security standards, plays an important role to ensure the whole security of an information/software system. ISO/IEC 15408 is a complex security standard which requires involvement of wide range of participants to perform a quite number of tasks as well as various documents. ISO/IEC 15408 is periodically reviewed and maintained to achieve ongoing improvement so that workflow of tasks and contents/format of documents related with the standard are changed according to changes of the standards. Consequently, it is difficult to do all of the tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 without any supporting tools. However, there is no study to identify which tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 can be supported by software tools. Indeed, no one makes clear what the tasks and participants exist. This paper presents the first analysis to identify all software supportable tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408. The paper enumerates all of the participants, documents, and tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 and shows relationship among them, and identifies all software supportable tasks. The analysis and its results become a basis to construct an information security engineering environment based on ISO/IEC 15408 for ensuring the whole security of an information/software system.},

  year={2008},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={487-494},
  abstract={Many methods have been studied for mining association rules efficiently. However, because these methods usually generate a large number of rules, it is still a heavy burden for the users to find the most interesting ones. In this paper, we propose a novel method for finding what the user is interested in by assigning several keywords, like searching documents on the WWW by search engines. We build an ontology to describe the concepts and relationships in the research domain and mine association rules by Genetic Network Programming from the database where the attributes are concepts in ontology. By considering both the semantic similarity between the rules and the keywords, and the statistical information like support, confidence, chi-squared value, we could rank the rules by a new method named RuleRank, where genetic algorithm is applied to adjust the parameters and the optimal ranking model is built for the user. Experiments show that our approach is effective for the users to find what they want.},

  title={Identification of Brain Activation Regions in Inductive Learning Based Scientific Creativity Test}, 
  year={2018},

  pages={950-957},
  abstract={Scientific creativity refers to exploration of original scientific development/creation. Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferably in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored by acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.},
