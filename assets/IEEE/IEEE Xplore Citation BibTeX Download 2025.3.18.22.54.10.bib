  abstract={With the introduction of fundamental concept computational thinking, Block-based programming tools are turning into more and more common in primary, middle and high school level introductory classes. Block-based programming languages support users to drag and drop different jigsaw shaped blocks and snapping together to form a program. The point of interest is on the programming logic rather than its syntax. In this paper, we present DB-Learn, a browser-based and visual programming environment. This facilitates to learn the concepts of relational algebra concepts. Relational algebra is one of the important concepts to learn and understand the operations of database management systems.},

  abstract={The authors introduce a new method for the establishment of an extension to current product models in order to enhanced communication between human and modeling processes. The main contribution of the reported work to product modeling is a dialogue input and model representation of human intent in order to make assistance for human who applies product model and needs important details from thinking process of human whom decision must be considered. The proposed method enforces human intent based definition of engineering objects. In order to achieve this, human intent representation is used at definition of engineering objectives for definition of engineering objects while contextual connections amongst intents, objectives and decisions, and amongst these entities and engineering objects are also considered. Consequences of changes of engineering objects are tracked along change chains in the change affect zones of the changed engineering objects. This modeling constitutes a new extension to classical product modeling and is placed between the human and the current information based product model in order to establish an efficient and coordinated control of engineering object parameters.},

  abstract={Use of archival collections is accelerated by the presence of finding aids, which communicate the arrangement and description of collection contents. To arrive at the optimal arrangement of a collection, archivists rely on some item-level processing or knowledge gained by exploring and manipulating digital reproductions of the contents. In this paper we consider archival student and instructor perspectives from hands-on course experiences directly with two distinct collections: one pertaining to the development, 2017 transfer and launch, and ongoing maintenance of the International Research Portal for Records Related to Nazi-Era Cultural Property (IRP2), and one a selection of unclassified catalog entries about digitized nuclear science reports. Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections.},

  abstract={In this global economy, the preparation of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with knowledge and understanding of critical computing concepts is essential. Our CPACE (Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs) vision is to revitalize undergraduate computing education within the engineering and technology fields. Our objective is to design and implement a process to engage stakeholders from multiple sectors and identify the computational tools and problem-solving skills and define how these skills-directly informed by industry needs-can be integrated across disciplinary curricula. By explicitly integrating computing concepts and disciplinary problem solving, engineering graduates will enter the workforce with improved and practice-ready computational thinking that will enhance their problem-solving and design skills. We present the analysis of the computational skills and the strategies that we are using to map the workforce problem-solving requirements onto the foundational computer science principles. We outline the framework that we are using to identify opportunities for curricular integration between computer science concepts and the disciplinary engineering curricula. By documenting, evaluating, and making the process explicit, this process can serve as a model for national efforts to strengthen undergraduate computing education in engineering.},

  abstract={In many introductory programming courses, the surface features of the programming language can distract and intimidate students so much that they fail to concentrate on what is really the ldquobrainyrdquo task: solving the problem conceptually. To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women.},

  abstract={Granular computing is a computation theory that imitates human thinking and reasoning by dealing with information at different levels of abstraction/precision. The adoption of granular computing approach in the design of data classification systems improves their performance in dealing with data uncertainty and facilitates handling large volumes of data. In this paper, a new approach for the design of medical data classification systems is proposed. The proposed approach makes use of data granulation in training the classifier. Training data is granulated at different levels and data from each level is used for constructing the classification system. To evaluate performance of the proposed approach, a classification system based on neural network is implemented. Four medical datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed approach to other classifiers: neural network classifier, ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier. Results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance of neural network classifier and produces better accuracy and area under curve than other classifiers for most of the datasets used.},

  abstract={The article reveals the main provisions of the development of a methodology for determining the level of political socialization of modern youth. The analysis of the available foreign and domestic interpretations of the concept of “political socialization” is carried out. The author's understanding of the political socialization of the individual is substantiated. The structural components of the political socialization of youth are highlighted, taking into account the age stage. The period of secondary socialization allowed the authors to identify four blocks - components of political socialization, which formed the basis of the questionnaire. Automation of the process of presenting the methodology and processing the survey data allows the respondent to get an idea of their own level of political socialization, and developers to route the individual - the need to eliminate gaps in political socialization by recommending the passage of certain correctional and developmental activities through the information and educational platform model being created in the future. The testing of the automated version of the methodology has shown its effectiveness in quickly and correctly determining the level of political socialization of young people. The technique can be used for both individual and group work.},

  abstract={The growing number of phishing attacks is one of the top concerns of cybersecurity researchers. Cryptographic methods are not reliable in stopping phishing attacks because they manipulate the users into thinking it is safe to access a web link. This results in compromise of sensitive information. Recent research has shown how machine learning methods are capable of detecting malicious websites. However, machine learning models can be computationally heavy to produce good accuracy. This paper focuses on reducing the computational cost while maintaining an effective prediction model. The experiment is conducted on a dataset of size (30, 10000), consisting of phishing and benign website links. The Isomap algorithm is implemented to reduce the input dimension while preserving correlation. Subsequently, a neural network is employed, utilizing simple activation and optimization functions to ensure efficient and rapid prediction. The model achieves an accuracy of 87% under 30 training epochs.},

  abstract={Modern mathematics careers are now requiring conceptual skills such as, critical thinking, modeling, and application of the content. This change in skillset needed for careers has strongly impacted mathematics curriculum and assessment. Meaningful assessment involves examining students' ability to inquire, to reason on targeted questions or tasks, and to promote conceptual understanding, not just focusing on discreet facts and principles. Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling. The assessment using Netlogo would be very useful for math educators to have good tools to assess students' conceptual understanding, as well as to develop instructional strategies used.},

Students in one lab section who used the simulations were compared to those in a control section who did not. A diagnostic quiz given before and after each lab provided a quantitative measure of improvement in learning via the lab experience for both groups. Content analysis of written and oral reports was used to measure any difference in higher level thinking demonstrated by the two groups. Student attitudes towards the simulations were assessed by surveys and end-of-course evaluations. Results so far, in the second year of a three-year project, indicate improvements in student satisfaction and learning but little change in critical thinking that can be attributed to the simulations.},

  pages={3698-3713},
  abstract={We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.},

  abstract={Reasoning about programs is an important component of computational thinking. Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in which programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain program behavior, or to uncover bugs. This paper presents Calypso, a language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for programming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a virtual world. The initial implementation of Calypso uses the Cozmo robot by Anki. Like Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws. An understanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental model of computation. Calypso provides a variety of affordances and scaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental models and facilitate computational thinking.},

  abstract={Logic Programming allows for the exploration and development of Computational Thinking skills. Those being abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and generalisation, among others, which are fundamental for problem-solving. What is more, Logic Programming helps building up Logical Thinking skills, also distinguishing valid arguments from fallacies and contradictions, as well as establishing connections between arguments through reasoning, to name some. These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction. This article introduces Metagame -Metajuego-, a methodological proposal which integrates key aspects to facilitate the effective integration of Logic Programming in primary education through collaborative and gamifying strategies. Furthermore, concrete cases of games are presented which have been formulated thanks to applying the proposed methodological approach to different educational contexts. The narratives upon which these games are based, incorporate learning cores presented in the curricular school designs where they were implemented.},

Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed.},

  abstract={This paper puts forward that organizing teaching of database course should take database design as trunk line to cultivate ability of Computational Thinking. The teaching organization starts from application scenarios, and combines database theoretical knowledge with the process from analysis, modeling to establishing database application. Using this method to organize teaching, the students learn to know the how and the why, not only to understand what database is, but also understand and grasp how to use, how to better use of database, thus their ability on analyzing and solving concrete problem is improved.},

  abstract={Nowadays, people, things, and processes are all connected to internet, and Internet of Everything (IoE) is addressing them conjointly. It is expected that these entities of IoE will communicate to one another, and produce a huge amount of invaluable data, thus generating a need to understand this kind of data. Computational approaches have shown their capabilities in extracting valuable information from such data. Usually these techniques focus on determining concrete concepts (particular activities such as driving, sitting, or entities like digit `1', `2' etc.). On the contrary, abstract concept identification (actions such as Motion-state, Static-state, or entity like `Number') is relatively less explored. In this article we present a methodology to model abstract representation of concepts without supervision, along with a mechanism to utilize generated models in an artificial system. Primarily, we illustrate a Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) approach that identifies abstract concepts, and dynamically builds a hierarchy to represent them. Further, we describe RANs learning, a novel way of associating concepts in two subsequent layers. We experimentally demonstrate how our approach is unsupervised, and able to model abstract activity (static-state and motion-state) of the subjects, using the Smart-phones Dataset from UCI machine learning repository for Human Activity Recognition problem.},

  abstract={This paper, in the domain of digital media, introduces the theoretical basis of possibilistic art. It models the bases of visual art in the atmosphere of possibilistic thought and the fuzzy geometry by introducing meaningful forms and introduces a way for recording and displaying emotional-behavioral responses of artist in the visualcomputational space. Finally, as a function of presented concepts, the paper introduces a semi-algorithm for meaningful deformation. This article, by representation of a method based on the eastern thinking and a computational thinking of the west, make a step in the way of eliminating the theoretic and instrumental shortages of visual arts of Iran in the grounds of computational arts.},
