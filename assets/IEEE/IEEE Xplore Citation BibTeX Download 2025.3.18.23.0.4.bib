  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism for computer generated forces (CGF). The proposed CGF can take actions similar to a human pilot to gain an advantageous status over the enemy target using the intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism. The mechanism will produce the best multi-step tactics combination (MSTC) for the CGF in an air combat environment. The MSTC is composed of CGF’s decision space. In this paper, based on our previous work, we propose a predictive multi-step fuzzy inference system (PMSFIS) as the automatic maneuvering mechanism for CGF, which incorporates and mimics human thinking capability and the maximum capacity of CGF. Before PMSFIS executes the fuzzy inference system (FIS) process, it will generate a list of MSTC, and allows CGF to predict its future posture corresponding to the list of MSTC. This paper assumes that CGF can accurately predict an enemy target’s future position, then PMSFIS applies the predicted data to generate the best MSTC. We verify the proposed algorithm with a set of fighter flying data that is used as the enemy target’s flying trajectory. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows that PMSFIS will enable CGF to obtain the best status in an air combat environment and improve the performance of our previous work.},

  abstract={Modeling of a phenomenon plays a key role in scientific thinking, and therefore an important issue in teaching science. Formulation of a model depends on methods to manipulate it. So far, differential equations have played a major role in scientific modeling because of model analysis using mathematics. However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.},

  pages={190-194},
  abstract={This paper aims to explore the use of advanced resource retrieval algorithms under the framework of ecolinguistics theory, especially the KL-divergence retrieval model, to optimize the resource distribution and personalized learning path design of the English wisdom classroom system. Firstly, this paper introduces the basic concepts of ecolinguistics, emphasizing the dynamic and interactive nature of ecolinguistics learning. A CAELL framework combining the principles of ecolinguistics is proposed. The framework promotes students' acquisition of ecological language in interaction with computers by simulating the natural ecological language environment. Then, this paper analyzes the working mechanism of KL-divergence retrieval model, which can quantify the differences between different resources so as to accurately match students' learning needs. The research team constructed a prototype English wisdom classroom system and conducted a one-semester experiment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that students adopting CAELL technology and KL-divergence retrieval model were significantly better than those students adopting traditional teaching model in terms of vocabulary mastery, grammar application and oral communication. In addition, through the data mining and analysis of the learning process, the study also reveals the regularity of students' learning behavior, which provides a basis for further optimizing personalized learning strategies. The application of the computer-aided ecolingual learning technology and learning resource retrieval model in the intelligent English classroom system not only improves the teaching effect, but also provides a new way of thinking and practice for the future development of intelligent education.},

  abstract={With the world becoming more and more reliant on technology, we are transitioning from a society that values rational evaluation over intuitive thinking to one in which both of those methods coexist. AI devices rely solely on rational evaluation and machine learning allows us to focus on intuition. The task of intelligence is to deduce which method should be relied upon when solving various problems via the establishment of realistic judgments, according to what kind it identifies as being best for that particular problem. However, human judgments cannot simply be quantitatively compared and ranked by a computer according to conditions set by algorithms because certain difficult-to-measure criteria are not easily passable through algorithm systems such as ethics and common sense. In this research, the authors focus on developing judgment classification models using random forest and support vector machine.

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1176-1180},
  abstract={Interpreting subjectively what makes a person persuasive in online videos is a complex and dynamic process that requires critical thinking and active engagement from the part of the observer. With the rapid expansion of online communication through social networking websites, more persuasive content is made available online in the form of video. The use of positive and/or negative opinions might affect how persuasive someone appears to be. Persuasiveness is at the core of everyday human-human interactions, such as defending a client in a court, seeking a patient's compliance with medical advice or convincing a customer to buy a product. This study is motivated by the argument that persuasive behavior changes with opinion polarity and whether a speaker is trying to persuade one in favor of or against something. Emotion plays a key role in persuasion both in verbal and non-verbal communication, therefore understanding the impact of opinion polarity (sentiment) on the persuasive messages becomes increasingly important. The study aims to explain the” emotion” behind the message as expressed in negative and positive opinions both persuasive and unpersuasive videos. The data used for the analysis is derived from Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) dataset which is an online multimodal dataset with existing labels for persuasive and non-persuasive videos placed in two sentiment or opinion polarities (positive and negative). This research paper also introduced a new neuromarketing assessment method called NeuroMap's NeuroScoring tool, previously designed to evaluate persuasive messages through a neuromarketing perspective. The present study results align with the NeuroMap model's emphasis on the role of emotions in persuasion. The persuasion model suggests that emotions directly impact how people process and memorize information and how persuasive messages that evoke positive emotions are more likely to be effective. In the study, sentiment levels can be seen as indicators of emotional content conveyed in the video messages, and the positive relationship between sentiment levels and persuasiveness supports the view that emotional appeal plays a crucial role in influencing persuasion.},

  abstract={The requirement for simulation science and technology (SST) professionals is expatiated and the capability structure of qualified professional simulationists is established. The structure is composed of five key factors including the ability of thinking, innovation, mastery of theories, researching and working. The ability elements is interpreted and described in detail. We emphasize that it is necessary to education institution to synchronize knowledge-based capability with non-knowledge-based capability. On current status of simulation education and training, we point out that establish SST discipline and implement SST education is the good way to develop standardized and high-quality professional simulationists.},

  abstract={It is argued that creating better system transparency leads to an increased understanding of a system, which gives users better indicators for placing their trust. This way of thinking is behind the author's interest for open systems. By opening up the source, the interfaces, the standardisation or the operational data, one gains the ability to better understand, and therefore to potentially trust, a system.},

  abstract={Processes in the mind: perception, cognition, concepts, instincts, emotions, and higher cognitive abilities for abstract thinking, beautiful music are considered here within a neural modeling fields (NMFs) paradigm. Its fundamental mathematical mechanism is a process ¿from vague-fuzzy to crisp,¿ called dynamic logic (DL). This paper discusses why this paradigm is necessary mathematically, and relates it to a psychological description of the mind. Surprisingly, the process from ¿vague to crisp¿ corresponds to Aristotelian understanding of mental functioning. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements confirmed this process in neural mechanisms of perception.},

  abstract={A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from suicidal ideation. As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion release, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms of suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual&#x0027;s suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93&#x0025; accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, <i>post, personality,</i> and <i>experience</i> are the top-3 key indicators. Under these categories, <i>posted text</i>, <i>stress level</i>, <i>stress duration</i>, <i>posted image</i>, and <i>ruminant thinking</i> contribute to one&#x0027;s suicidal ideation detection.},
