  abstract={This paper reports our experiences in reimplementing an entry-level graduate course in high-performance parallel computing aimed at physical scientists and engineers. These experiences have directly informed a significant redesign of a junior/senior undergraduate course, Introduction to High-Performance Computing (CS 4225 at Georgia Tech), which we are implementing for the current Spring 2012 semester. Based on feedback from the graduate version, the redesign of the undergraduate course emphasizes peer instruction and hands-on activities during the traditional lecture periods, as well as significant time for end-to-end projects. This paper summarizes our anecdotal findings from the graduate version's exit surveys and briefly outlines our plans for the undergraduate course.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a CARES model for computing education. It consists of three layers: core layer (“think”), course layer (“learn”) and career/development layer (“develop”). The core layer is concerned with two fundamental thinking skills: computational thinking and creative thinking. The course layer is about the curriculum. The career/development layer is for development in four major areas: Application (applying knowledge), Research (advancing knowledge), Entrepreneurship (innovating/realizing knowledge) and Service (serving with knowledge). A freshman seminar subject has been designed based on the application, research and entrepreneurship elements of the CARES model, and the teaching experience for this subject is presented.},

  pages={499-509},
  abstract={Recent studies of creative cognition have revealed interactions between functional brain networks involved in the generation of novel ideas; however, the neural basis of creativity is highly complex and presents a great challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience, partly because of ambiguity around how to assess creativity. We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance—and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Complete Work presents the category of Innovate Practice. Digital social grouping is now a common practice for exchanging any kind of data between group connections. However, this has posed some key issues for education professionals on the best path to the current educational system to fully embrace this practice and move on. [1] It suggests that “the school model as we know it is over. It makes no sense to students, does not produce expected results, nor prepares the new generations for the challenges of contemporary life.” To fill this gap, an innovative teaching model emerged as an alternative approach centered on the student and reinforced by the pedagogical and technological infrastructures. This work presents a framework as a computational tool to build and provide custom educational interfaces based on the concept of persuasion to push users to the most relevant content (eg, direction). This structure is based on participatory elements from various disciplines that cross the fields of education, computational engineering and psychology. The proposed framework shows that user interactions explored from the persuasion, engagement, and content customization techniques take into account the skills, needs and interests make teaching more attractive and applicable.},

  abstract={Cultivating students’ ability to use emerging technologies for innovation is important for the reform of new business education. Technological change needs the thinking revolution essentially so the big data system is of great significance for the construction of talent training programs, implementation of competency requirements, and curriculum teaching design. This study was carried out to identify the main enablers of the big data computation (BTC) in improving the innovation capability of students majoring in business and developing a model based on the contextual relationship among the identified enablers. Initially, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the enablers of BTC. Then, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was used to evolve mutual relationships among the identified 17 enablers for developing a hierarchical model. Five key driving enablers, namely data consciousness, system thinking, statistical thinking, model thinking, and analytical thinking were identified as main enablers. Image thinking played an important role in the process of data analysis and application. Suggestions were made to cultivate the student’s BTC from the following three aspects: adding system science courses in the big data specialty, increasing training opportunities for students in using tools and methods of big data management, and improving students' data literacy.},

  year={2020},
  volume={26},
  number={1},
  pages={343-352},
  abstract={Think-aloud protocols are widely used by user experience (UX) practitioners in usability testing to uncover issues in user interface design. It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).},

The flipped classroom model for the course is primarily classified into three stages: pre-class, in-class, and after-class. In the pre-class stage, teachers used online learning platform and MOOC course materials as a tool to help students make due preparation for classroom. In the in-class stage, teachers organized active learning activities featured by experiential learning and collaborative peer work. In the afterclass stage, teachers design practice-oriented and problem-based assignment for students to reflect on the learning content. Meanwhile, it is important for instructors to provide detailed instructions on how to learn with the learning materials prior to class and focus on cultivating students’ higher order thinking skills in the teaching and learning process.},

  abstract={Granular computing emerges as a new multi-disciplinary study and has received much attention in recent years. A conceptual framework is presented by extracting shared commonalities from many fields. The framework stresses multiple views and multiple levels of understanding in each view. It is argued that granular computing is more about a philosophical way of thinking and a practical methodology of problem solving. By effectively using levels of granularity, granular computing provides a systematic, natural way to analyze, understand, represent, and solve real world problems. With granular computing, one aims at structured thinking at the philosophical level, and structured problem solving at the practical level.},

  volume={11},

  pages={5266-5274},
  abstract={As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

  abstract={STEM learning from an early age is essential to confirm that students are prepared to meet the needs of the world they will inherit. Currently, there are incredible and inexpensive technologies to keep students engaged and passionate about their learning. A drone is a handson apparatus that could be incorporated in STEM for several learning applications such as class projects, experiments, and exploration. In this paper, the STEMcoding framework is designed for kids to learn coding using a drone and Scratch programming. This platform attempts to visualize their coding by drone while Scratch makes a gaming environment to enhance their programming using block-based learning. The platform has applied in a STEM event at the University of Wisconsin Platteville and the results show the benefit of utilizing drone in STEM-coding as follows: i) transforms abstract concepts into concrete learning, ii) delivers an entertaining and motivating learning environment, iii) combines STEM theory with practice, and iv) provides a hand-on skill which is dynamic and attractive.},

  abstract={The Virtual Cell modeling and simulation framework is the product of interdisciplinary research in biology that applies the diverse strengths and experiences of individuals from engineering, the physical sciences, the biological sciences, and mathematics. A key feature is the separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This reduces software complexity, allowing independent development and verification, but most importantly it clarifies the impact of modeling decisions, assumptions, and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modeling and simulation framework for cell biology. The Virtual Cell has a rich, interactive user interface which connects to remote services providing scalable access to a modeling database and a large dedicated cluster for shared computation and storage. In addition to new modeling capabilities, future developments will emphasize data and tool interoperability, extensibility, and experimentally oriented model analysis tools},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1680-1683},
  abstract={Style transfer has been proven to be effective in mitigating domain shift in clinical settings, enhancing the adaptability of pathology image models. However, existing methods assume that the texture of the entire image is domain-specific and irrelevant to class-specific representations. These methods enhance all regions with a single style, which can result in information loss. In this work, we propose CLAP (Cross-modality Local Augmentation for histoPathology), a data augmentation approach that enables cross-modality local manipulation for pathology images. Specifically, the combination of a text extractor network and a feature mapping network enables the integration of CLIP embeddings for style descriptions into editable latent spaces at a fine-grained level. This approach prevents the loss of regional information in whole-slide images, eliminates the need to painstakingly select directions in latent space, and enhances creativity style selection. Experimental results demonstrate that CLAP improves the regional accuracy of cross-modality editing and achieves state-of-the-art performance by enhancing generalization in histopathology classification tasks.},

  abstract={In this poster, we study the problem of maximizing profit level and minimizing network price for Mobile Edge Computing platform, while proposing an optimal economic model. This exposes the tradeoff between profit level of network operators and network price of Edge Users (EUs), which is captivated by both the operators and EUs, and allows the operator to handle an optimal economic specification design. We consider the problem of maximum profit with minimum network price problem (MPP) as optimization problem, and present heuristics to obtain the upgrade series optimally. Preliminary outcome presents that the proposed model increases the profit level by 20 % and reduces network price by 30% compared to general edge and cloud platform.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a study proposal with the intent of knowing Scratch potential in Educational Sciences students' training. In this study, we analyse, through different phases, using Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model (KEM), the benefits of Scratch inclusion in Educational Sciences degree and in its students' future professional activities. In this work an action-investigation methodology is used. This investigation will allow to improve the education curriculum at different levels, in a technological way, with impact on the teaching and learning process, involving students and teachers of all levels. In higher education this software has been especially associated with programming and computing disciplines as a tool for motivating students or as a learning facilitator. This work presents not only an innovative approach of the Scratch utilization, the improvement of learning skills and competences of design regarding the production of educational materials, but also its use in a new area - the idea of a programmer-educator concept. This paper also presents a pre-study regarding the necessary skills to the use of Scratch and its use among first level students focusing in their satisfaction and motivation for this software use.},

  abstract={Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) train neural networks that combine the topological properties of a graph with the vertex and edge features to perform tasks such as node classification and link prediction. We propose a novel middleware that approaches GNN training from the perspective of a vertex-centric model (VCM) of distributed graph processing and overlays neural network training over it. Giraph Graph Neural Network (G2N2) uses a three-phase execution pattern by construction a distributed computation graph per mini-batch, and maps the forward and backward passes of the GNN training to VCM. We implement a prototype of G2N2 in Apache Giraph and report results from a preliminary evaluation using two real-world graphs on a commodity cluster.},
