  abstract={RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate biological functions by interacting with specific RNAs, and play an important role in many life activities. Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.},

  title={Genetic Algorithm Optimization of Teams for Heterogeneity}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives." Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender. While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization.},

  title={Deep Learning-Based Hypothesis Generation Model and Its Application on Virtual Chinese Calligraphy-Writing Robot}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={87243-87251},
  abstract={In recent years, a tremendous amount of effort has been devoted to modeling the cognition of human brain, particularly hypothesis generation process. Most research of the hypothesis generation model is probability-based. However, computation of human brains is still neuron-based instead of calculating the probability. As an attempt to solve this problem in this paper, we propose a novel neuron-based hypothesis generation model, called hypothesis generation net, to model human cognition, including how to make decisions and how to do actions. Basically, the proposed hypothesis generation model consists of two parts, i.e., a hypothesis model and an evaluation model. When these two models interact, the system is able to generate hypotheses to solve complex tasks based on historical experiences. To validate the feasibility of the proposed hypothesis generation model, we show a virtual robot with its cognition system can learn how to write Chinese calligraphy in a simulation environment, where an image-to-action translation via a cognitive framework is proposed to learn the pattern of Chinese characters. Based on the proposed deep thinking and learning mechanism, the virtual robot is able to write Chinese calligraphy well, which is a difficult task requiring extremely complicated motions, through thinking and practicing according to a human writing sample.},

  title={Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for CO-OFDM: The Matched-Filter Approach}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={36},
  number={14},
  pages={2955-2965},
  abstract={This paper proposes a novel carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for the coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems using the matched-filter (MF) concept. We consider an OFDM symbol with N subcarriers so that the receiver takes N time samples of the received noisy CO-OFDM signal. Our idea is to first append these N received samples with (L - 1)N zeros at the end to get a sequence of LN time samples. By taking the discrete Fourier transform of these LN samples, we compute the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol at LN discrete frequency points. We think of this spectrum as being made up of L sets of N points each, each set consisting of the frequency points {2π/LN l, 2π/LN l + 2π/N , . . . , 2π/LN l + 2π(N -1)/N}, for each value of l, where l = 0, 1, . . . , L - 1. Each set of N points for one value of l can be considered as the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol corresponding to one hypothesized value 2π/LN l of the CFO. The receiver can now obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimate by determining the hypothesized value that best matches the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol received from the channel. In the case of data-aided (DA) ML estimation, we treat the OFDM symbol as a pilot symbol in which we know the data in all the subcarriers, and this pilot symbol is used as the reference signal for the MF. In the case of blind (BL) ML estimation, the data in all the subcarriers are unknown, and the receiver uses an OFDM symbol with no data modulation in all the subcarriers as the reference signal. After making the ML decision of the hypothesized value of the CFO, a fine search will be carried out to determine the actual value more accurately. It turns out only one step is necessary to locate the actual value of the CFO. The DA MF ML algorithm can achieve full-range (integral and fractional part) CFO estimation with high accuracy, while the BL MF ML algorithm has low computational complexity but focuses on the fractional CFO estimation only. We discuss the complexity and performance of this MF ML algorithm, and present simulation results to demonstrate the estimation error variance for 16-PSK/QAM modulations. The simulation results show that the estimation error variance of the DA MF ML algorithm can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the absence of the laser phase noise.},

  abstract={The design process is often characterized by and realized through the iterative steps of evaluation and refinement. When the process is based on a single creative domain such as visual art or audio production, designers primarily take inspiration from work within their domain and refine it based on their own intuitions or feedback from an audience of experts from within the same domain. What happens, however, when the creative process involves more than one creative domain such as in a digital game? How should the different domains influence each other so that the final outcome achieves a harmonized and fruitful communication across domains? How can a computational process orchestrate the various computational creators of the corresponding domains so that the final game has the desired functional and aesthetic characteristics? To address these questions, this paper identifies game facet orchestration as the central challenge for artificial-intelligence-based game generation, discusses its dimensions, and reviews research in automated game generation that has aimed to tackle it. In particular, we identify the different creative facets of games, propose how orchestration can be facilitated in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, review indicative preliminary examples of orchestration, and conclude by discussing the open questions and challenges ahead.},

Within the sciences area we can highlight the technologies for the study of programming and robotics, that help students of all skill levels to develop their logical thinking and propose functional prototypes to solve their problems of everyday life. The applicability of these technologies makes them excellent learning objects by allowing interaction with learners. This article presents a case of successful implementation of a robotics lab for a city of the state of Espirito Santo, in Brazil, which is now in replication, to ensure access to this technology to all students of elementary school.

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an emergent system in which an autonomous mobile robot can acquire environment oriented behavior. In the general robotic engineering, a system designer gave the model of environment and sensory-motor commands beforehand. However, we think that the autonomous robot has to be developed through the interaction between robot's behavior and the environmental information by itself. So, we construct the controller for the autonomous robot to acquire the adaptive behavior with the chaotic neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, we make use of the dynamic learning method (DLM) as an on-line learning method. The results of the computational experiments show the chaotic search of this network plays an important role for the acquisition of the adaptive behavior.},

  abstract={As a summer camp for middle school and high school students, a new method of learning/teaching computer science was explored: Teaching high schoolers MIT's App Inventor for 2 weeks and then during the following two weeks, having the high schoolers teach middle schoolers ranging from upcoming 6th to 9th graders. The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with. This paper presents the organization of the summer programming camp, contents and learning outcome.},

  year={2025},
  volume={31},
  number={1},
  pages={1191-1201},
  abstract={Interactive visualizations are powerful tools for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), but how do they affect the observations analysts make about their data? We conducted a qualitative experiment with 13 professional data scientists analyzing two datasets with Jupyter notebooks, collecting a rich dataset of interaction traces and think-aloud utterances. By qualitatively coding participant utterances, we introduce a formalism that describes EDA as a sequence of analysis states, where each state is comprised of either a representation an analyst constructs (e.g., the output of a data frame, an interactive visualization, etc.) or an observation the analyst makes (e.g., about missing data, the relationship between variables, etc.). By applying our formalism to our dataset, we identify that interactive visualizations, on average, lead to earlier and more complex insights about relationships between dataset attributes compared to static visualizations. Moreover, by calculating metrics such as revisit count and representational diversity, we uncover that some representations serve more as “planning aids” during EDA rather than tools strictly for hypothesis-answering. We show how these measures help identify other patterns of analysis behavior, such as the “80-20 rule”, where a small subset of representations drove the majority of observations. Based on these findings, we offer design guidelines for interactive exploratory analysis tooling and reflect on future directions for studying the role that visualizations play in EDA.},

  abstract={This paper describes the outcomes of a three-day teacher professional development workshop aimed at introducing concepts, principles and practices of computational thinking. The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education.},

  title={Assessing the Readiness of Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers in Utilizing the Scratch Application: A Case Study at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes the readiness of pre-service mathematics teachers to incorporate Scratch, a block-based programming application, into mathematics instruction, focusing on their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Given the rapid technological advancements, leveraging technology in mathematics education is crucial in fostering proficient problem-solving abilities among students. Consequently, computational thinking is recognized as a vital 21st-century competency, a transferable skill for effective problem-solving methods. The study underscores the importance of integrating Scratch, a supportive tool in computational thinking, into mathematics education. However, to integrate this application into mathematics education, pre-service teachers must be prepared to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and to be ready to accept its use in teaching in the future. The construction of knowledge by pre-service mathematics teachers regarding the Scratch application is examined through the lens of social constructivism, which emphasizes knowledge construction through experience and social interaction. A purposive sample of 60 first- and second-year students participated in an online survey. The sample selection involving two groups aimed to identify significant differences in pre-service teachers' readiness levels across gender, study year, and academic achievement. The findings revealed limited proficiency among pre-service mathematics teachers in utilizing Scratch, particularly regarding its integration into mathematics instruction. Several factors contribute to the deficiency in skills among pre-service mathematics teachers in navigating the Scratch application, including requiring additional time to grasp the programming language employed in the application, challenges in arranging blocks to achieve desired outputs, and struggles in rectifying syntax errors. However, there was a positive attitude towards the application, indicating a strong inclination to enhance their skills. The study also found no significant differences in demographic variables such as gender, study year, or academic achievement, but a slight correlation exists between knowledge, attitudes, and academic achievement. Investigating pre-service teachers' readiness to integrate Scratch into mathematics instruction sheds light into the intersection between mathematics pedagogy and computational thinking. This intersection underscores the importance of integrating programming tools like Scratch into mathematics education to cultivate computational thinking skills. Additionally, the findings contribute to the broader discourse on the role of technology in education and highlight the need for enhanced training and support for pre-service teachers in leveraging technology effectively for instructional purposes.},

A grand challenge is to adapt ML and XAI to human goals, concepts, values, and ways of thinking. Complementing the current efforts in XAI towards solving this challenge, VA can contribute by exploiting the potential of visualization as an effective way of communicating information to humans and a strong trigger of human abstractive perception and thinking.

  abstract={One argument in the discussion about the adoption of UML in industry is the supposedly large effort it takes to do modeling. Our study explores how the creation of UML models can be understood to consist of different cognitive activities: (i) designing: thinking about the design (ideation, key-design decision making), (ii) notation expression: expressing a design in a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in a diagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of 100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on software models as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% of the effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing. Notation expression is around 41% of the model creation effort and layouting is in the order of 3%. This finding suggests that a significant part of creating models is devoted to design thinking about the problem.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) are being criticized for copyright infringement, inadvertent bias in training data, a danger to human innovation, the possibility of distributing incorrect or misleading information, and prejudice. Due to their popularity among students, the introduction of many comparable apps, and the inability to resist unfair and fraudulent student usage, their educational use needs to be adapted and harmonized. The incorporation of LLMs should be defined not only by pedagogues and educational institutions, but also by students who will actively utilize them to learn and prepare assignments. In order to find out what students from two universities think and suggest about LLMs use in education, they were asked to give their contribution by answering the survey that was conducted at the beginning of the spring semester of academic 2022/23. Their feedback was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, showing in a better light what students think about LLMs and how and why they would use them. Based on the analysis, the authors propose an original strategy for integrating LLMs into education. The proposed approach is also adapted for those students who are not interested in using LLMs and for those who prefer the hybrid mode by combining their own research with LLMs generated recommendations. The authors expect that by implementing the proposed strategy, schools will benefit from a better education in which research, creativity, academic honesty, recognition of false information, and the ability to improve knowledge will prevail.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become an essential skill nowadays. Many educational institutions around the world have adopted computational thinking as an elementary or complementary subject in their teaching schedules. One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people.},

  year={2014},

  abstract={Existing studies on the propagation of infectious diseases have not sufficiently considered the uncertainties that are related to individual behavior and its influence on individual decision making to prevent infections, even though it is well known that changes in behavior can lead to variations in the macrodynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. These influencing factors can be categorized into emotion-related and cognition-related components. We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example. We find that individual decision making against infections (frequent washing, respirator usage, and crowd contact avoidance) can significantly decrease the at-peak number of infected patients, even when common policies, such as isolation and vaccination, are not deployed.},

  title={Hybrid Model Integrating Fuzzy Systems and Convolutional Factorization Machine for Delivery Time Prediction in Intelligent Logistics}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={33},
  number={1},
  pages={406-417},
  abstract={Logistics distribution plays a crucial role in smart logistics systems, with delivery time prediction being a key issue. Accurately predicting the delivery time of parcels positively impacts logistics companies, couriers, and customers. However, traditional delivery time prediction models struggle to handle potential noise and redundant information in existing features effectively. Moreover, the interaction between various features is often overlooked, and the combination of features is ignored in predicting results. In addition, previous prediction models based on fully connected networks, while capable of learning nonlinear mappings between features, fail to capture local information among features, leading to suboptimal performance on specific datasets. In addition, the intelligent system collects data from multiple sources, introducing ambiguity, which cannot be addressed by fully connected networks in reasoning about the ambiguity among various data. This work proposes a hybrid model using a fuzzy system and convolutional factorization machine (FSCFM) to address the abovementioned challenges. The FSCFM model integrates the local information capture capability of 1-D convolutional neural networks, the automatic feature combination ability of factorization machines, and the reasoning capability of fuzzy systems. This integration allows for a more accurate prediction of delivery times. Multiple experiments were conducted on a real logistics delivery dataset, confirming the practicality of the FSCFM model.},

  title={ANNet: A Lightweight Neural Network for ECG Anomaly Detection in IoT Edge Sensors}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={16},
  number={1},
  pages={24-35},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection and system level power reduction of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) Edge sensors. The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected appliances, sensors, and databases that aim to improve human life quality in various life fields. To enhance agricultural productivity quantitively and in terms of quality, farmers have adopted the emerging IoT and communication technologies to establish automated monitoring and control systems. This adoption of novel technologies enables farmers to deal with traditional practice problems. However, the solutions provided by this new concept reveal a wide range of research issues. Since security and privacy are the top concerns in IoT environments, it's important to think about potential attacks and develop countermeasures. In this paper, we present a simple security analysis in the IoT-based smart agriculture field. Then, considering the crucial role of authentication in IoT security, we reviewed the different classes of authentication in this field.},

  abstract={Coding (programming) is a skill that nowadays is considered as an important asset. Teaching programming is an activity that becomes more and more popular. In the last few years there are great discussions on inclusion of coding in schools. These initiatives impacted the policy makers in Macedonia to include coding as a part of a new compulsory subject for the pupils at the age of 8. In this paper our focus is on the newest change in the Macedonian curriculum - the introduction of the course "Working with computers and basics of programming", which can be shortly named as "Computing" in 2015. Here, we present the proposed and accepted curriculum with emphasis on the topics about computational thinking and programming. Then we discuss the available software and tools suitable for the implementation of the before mentioned topics, and present a newly developed game. At the end we explain the background of the teachers, give the format of the preliminary training of all primary school teachers in the country and present the first impressions of the trainers that conducted the training, and we elaborate the teachers' feedback.},

  abstract={Mainstream media report that governments and business leaders see AI as an "extinction-level threat" to humans. In posthumanism, we find, besides conceptional tools for thinking technology in an indeterministic way, also argumentations for singularity, accelerationism and appeasement towards strong AI. Notwithstanding the heterogeneity of the field, the eminent posthumanist claim that autonomous machines can be a conscient other is a fallacy. An analysis of computer language as Derridean writing shows that computational, supposedly autonomous machines run on algorithmic, linguistic, written code. As such, they are extensions of human cognition. To proclaim machines conscient and autonomous, is hence not just misleading per se, but disguises the human agency that uses the AI-autonomy as a proxy.},

  title={A Type-2 Fuzzy Ontology and Its Application to Personal Diabetic-Diet Recommendation}, 
  year={2010},
  volume={18},
  number={2},
  pages={374-395},
  abstract={ It has been widely pointed out that classical ontology is not sufficient to deal with imprecise and vague knowledge for some real-world applications like personal diabetic-diet recommendation. On the other hand, fuzzy ontology can effectively help to handle and process uncertain data and knowledge. This paper proposes a novel ontology model, which is based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), called type-2 fuzzy ontology (T2FO), with applications to knowledge representation in the field of personal diabetic-diet recommendation. The T2FO is composed of 1) a type-2 fuzzy personal profile ontology ( type-2 FPPO); 2) a type-2 fuzzy food ontology ( type-2 FFO); and 3) a type-2 fuzzy-personal food ontology (type-2 FPFO). In addition, the paper also presents a T2FS-based intelligent diet-recommendation agent ( IDRA), including 1) T2FS construction; 2) a T2FS-based personal ontology filter; 3) a T2FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism; 4) a  T2FS-based diet-planning mechanism; 5) a T2FS-based menu-recommendation mechanism; and 6) a T2FS-based semantic-description mechanism. In the proposed approach, first, the domain experts plan the diet goal for the involved diabetes and create the nutrition facts of common Taiwanese food. Second, the involved diabetics are requested to routinely input eaten items. Third, the ontology-creating mechanism constructs a T2FO, including a type-2 FPPO, a type-2 FFO, and a set of type-2 FPFOs. Finally, the  T2FS-based IDRA retrieves the built T2FO to recommend a personal diabetic meal plan. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can work effectively and that the menu can be provided as a reference for the involved diabetes after diet validation by domain experts. },
