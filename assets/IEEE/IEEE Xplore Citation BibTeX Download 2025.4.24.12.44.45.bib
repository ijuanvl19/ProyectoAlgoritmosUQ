  abstract={Openflow provides a key step in abstracting network functions by separating the control and the forwarding plane. However, current rather rigid switches constrain packet processing programmability. It is therefore complex to implement flexible packet classification within existing ASIC-based switches, especially when forwarding switches rely on a restricted set of tables. In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism for assigning rule entries to switch tables. Accordingly, we propose a conceptual abstraction that tailors Openflow forwarding paths to the hardware switch. Our approach aims to provide an optimal mapping of entries to physical tables. Its main idea consists in using a semantic analysis to reflect the computational relation between rules and a set of packet descriptors characterized by predefined table entries.},

  abstract={With the development and improvement of the computer application technology, great progress has been made in the computer technology. In this paper, the application of CAD and multimedia technology is combined to carry out the industrial design methods and experience. From the perspective of the overall process of the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the design expression of the modern creativity, Chinese traditional handicrafts still have great research value in the process of promoting the expression of the modern creative design. The existing creative design expression methods have the problems of high feature dimensions, large computational overhead or relatively low detection rate and so on. In this paper, a kind of traditional Chinese handicrafts that promote the expression of the modern creative design based on the computer multimedia technology is put forward. This method is aimed at the modern creative processing of the traditional Chinese handicrafts, using the computer multimedia technology to process the traditional Chinese handicrafts. The experimental results show that this method has relatively low time complexity and high detection rate than those of the traditional methods. In addition, it has relatively good robustness for the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the expression of the modern creative design.},

  year={2006},
  volume={},

  pages={184-192},
  abstract={Functional design is a process in engineering design that impacts the key features of the design result. Few computational tools exist to assist designers during the functional design, and functional design success is often heavily weighted on personal experience and innate ability. This paper proposes an automated functional design approach which is supported by formalization effect in TRIZ. The standardized sets of functions and flows are intended to comprehensively describe the design space. The function types derived from the relation between input and output flows identify the external behavior. Effects can fulfill transition from inputs to output, and the happening of sub-behaviors depends upon effects. By integrating the Z formal specification style with the semi-formal object-oriented Fusion method, the effect and effect modes are formalized to facilitate rigorous reasoning about behavior and the creation of concise models. Based on six effect modes and three link methods, multiple effect chains can be generated to achieve the external behavior. The structure is confirmed by mapping between effects and examples based on the analysis of patents. An engineering example of air exhaust valve in car is presented to demonstrate the proposed functional design methodology.},

  abstract={Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.},

  abstract={Summary form only for tutorial. Measuring systems and instruments are becoming more and more complex and are presently capable of performing advanced measurement operations. The recent developments in sensor technology, analog-to-digital converters, and computational capabilities of DSP devices, and the relative simplicity with which these components can be interconnected have opened new possibilities to measurement science and practice. These developments are revealing a number of new issues involving the very fundamentals of the measurement science, from the definition of a new measurement paradigm to the metrological characterization of the measured results. This tutorial is therefore aimed at reconsidering these basic issues, having in mind their application to the modern measuring systems. A model of the measurement process, as a bridge between the empirical world and the world of knowledge and abstract concepts, will be presented. Within this model, the measurement process is only capable of providing incomplete knowledge (the measurement result) about the measurand. It will be shown how an incomplete knowledge about the measurand is still acceptable, provided that we are capable of estimating how incomplete this knowledge is. Starting from this consideration, the methods for characterizing the result of a measurement will be discussed, focusing mainly on the uncertainty, calibration, and traceability concepts. A short survey on the International Metrology Organizations will be also given. After having introduced the basic concept of metrology, a basic instrument diagram will be introduced, and the diagram of the modern systems based on digital signal processing techniques will be discussed in deeper details.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Efficiently searching encrypted data within web applications presents a significant challenge for software engineers, primarily because traditional search methods necessitate decrypting each record individually to check for matches, leading to considerable computational overhead. The authors in this paper introduce an optimized search methodology for encrypted data in Laravel web applications by implementing a Coded Search Parameter (CSP). By incorporating an additional attribute into the MySQL database entity, which stores a coded representation of the initial character of the encrypted data - we substantially reduce server resource consumption and search time. During the search process, the algorithm initially executes a query filtered by the CSP attribute value, effectively narrowing down potential matches before decrypting the now reduced set of records. This approach also ensures that personal data remains protected without compromising data security. In this paper we provide a detailed exposition of the CSP method's implementation, evaluate its impact on search efficiency and present performance improvement analyses compared to traditional encrypted data search methods. Based on the research findings, it is concluded that the CSP method in Laravel applications significantly reduces search time for encrypted data, achieving an average acceleration of 73.58%.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice category full paper describes the benefits of undergraduate research and through online research demonstrates the methods used by the higher education institutions to introduce their students to research. We conducted at the home institution a survey of students not previously involved in research and found that most engineering students (88%) are interested in undertaking research. 83% of students would like to engage in both laboratory and computational work for their research. The research topics of most interest to students in descending order are sustainability aerospace applications, energy, materials, infrastructure, and robotics. Students believe that the most significant benefit from research is developing skills other than those taught in their classes (i.e., creativity, diligence) and that the major barrier to not performing research is either not having time or not knowing how to start. Students would be mostly interested in research if the research project is of interest to them and they are less eager to publish and present their research results at engineering conferences and other venues. 61% of students wish to collaborate with other students on research projects under the guidance of a faculty member. To increase the first-year students' interest in research and develop an entrepreneurial mindset, the paper presents a project that can be incorporated in the Introduction to Engineering course. First-year students are asked to develop and answer their own research questions and learn how to pursue patents for their discoveries. Such projects can help students understand what research is and make them start working on faculty mentored research projects as soon as their first year.},

  abstract={It has been reported that human thoughts processes of sensory-motor functions as well as high level of cognitive processes may be highly reproducible between multiple trials as measured via functional MRI data. This trend of the reproducibility seems consistent between multiple subjects as well. We have also presented in our earlier study that six distinct thought processes were shown highly consistent spatial patterns of activations as evaluated from automated classification performance. In the present study, this automated classification performance was compared depending on the feature vector selection methods. A general linear model (GLM) was adopted to define a neuronal activity and voxel-based or atlas-based approaches were adopted as feature vector selection methods. The classification results showed superior performance from the voxel-based feature selection method than the atlas-based method. Nonetheless, when multiple atlases were used to defined feature vector elements, the resulting performance was comparable to that of the voxel-based method with greatly reduced computational time.},

  pages={274-278},
  abstract={In the present paper, an autonomation system based on fuzzy logic is proposed for a steel wire rolling mill to minimize a quality problem related to surface finish. Autonomation is a lean manufacturing concept that integrates automation with a human factor. The ability of self-diagnosis is achieved in the automated line by incorporating a computational intelligence tool like fuzzy logic. The decision support model proposed here provides intelligent decisive signals similar to the fuzzy capability of human brain. Fuzzy Logic control (FLC) model is designed to recognize the events that are likely to create defects and output action signals are generated. Speed difference between conveyor rollers and rolled products, percentage of carbon content and impact force on groove rollers are the three inputs and it produces two outputs in the form of either Andon (a visual signal) or line stoppage. By using Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) autonomation system, surface defects can be prevented by monitoring level of inputs.},

  abstract={Through observation of a large number of numerical simulations in engineering application, we find that the resonance response calculation of traditional volume-surface integral equation (VSIE) method based on volume equivalence principle (VEP) is not accurate enough. We are used to thinking that this is because of the mismatch of normal component of electric fields on medium-metal interface. However, in this paper, through strict formula derivation, we proved that the normal boundary condition of electrical fields and the continuity equation of electric currents at the medium-metal interface are implicit in the solving process of VSIE with method of moment (MoM). We agree that not the normal component but the tangential component mismatch is responsible for the frequency deviation of VSIE simulation. Furthermore, the singularity treatment of Green's function with singular term extraction is also presented in this paper with strict deduction in special case of model discretization with quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, which would be quite useful for reducing the number of unknowns, improving the matrix condition and enhancing the accuracy for electromagnetic simulation in FSS (frequency selected surface) or IC (integrated circuits) applications.},

  abstract={In the stage of schematic design, some data needed to calculate design cooling load can not be supplied with accurate values, designers have to assess a value according to their experience only. The calculation of a building's design cooling load is different from the load analysis of existing buildings, it is a prediction of the maximum possible load of a future building when it is put into use, so it has the characteristic of uncertainty and prediction. In order to improve calculation efficiency and enhance accuracy, expert system technology is introduced and incorporated with a load index assessment method. Consequently, an expert system for the calculation of a building's design cooling load is established on the basis of artificial neural network theories. Application examples indicate that this system is simple and workable; the calculation results thereof achieve high accuracy, and calculation methods are in conformity to the thinking habits of designers.},

  year={2012},
  volume={40},
  number={10},
  pages={2408-2415},
  abstract={The effects of soil dry density and water content are being examined through experimental time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) methods in correlation with electromagnetic simulations. The infiltration rate (hydraulic conductivity) of water in sand is exceptionally high, resulting in heterogeneous moisture distribution through the soil. The effective dielectric constant of the soil/water/air mixture is dependent on the soil's dry density and moisture content. Both TDR and FDR methods are performed on a coaxial transmission line filled with a soil/water/air mixture. The flow of the water through the soil creates a dynamic situation in which the soil/water/air electrical impedance changes over time. The resulting soil has heterogeneous water content, creating varying electrical impedance values along the length of the coaxial line. The soil compaction, i.e., dense or loose, has significant impact on the heterogeneity of the moisture content through the soil and the dry density of the soil. In each case, the effective dielectric constant is determined from the data collected from TDR and FDR experiments, and the values are compared with the predictions using established empirical models by Topp, Hilhorst, and Hendrickx. With the exception of the data represented as a function of the degree of saturation, the Hendrickx model appears to best represent the measured dielectric constants since it falls within two standard deviations of the measured data. A computer simulation technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used to supplement experimental observations of various soil moisture contents in a coaxial cell. Simulations confirm that the change in the dielectric constant through the soil is a result of the heterogeneous moisture distribution. It was found that the soil moisture content has a major impact on the resulting dielectric constant from measurements or modeling. In the coaxial-cell device, soil moisture migration during the testing period results in a heterogeneous moisture regime and a temporal dielectric constant. This is particularly exaggerated for high-hydraulic-conductivity soils such as sand.},

  volume={37},

  pages={724-737},
  abstract={The application of wide-band gap semiconductors and their integration with other power electronics components (e.g., passives, gate drivers, sensing, thermal management) can meet the growing demand for volume reduction in power electronics systems. The design of such an integrated system is a complex multiphysics problem given the high number of variables to identify, objectives to optimize, and constraints to satisfy. Traditionally, this complex problem is approached subdividing the design in different steps, where in each step, the single components are designed and optimized independently from the others. This might clearly overlook the effect that the design choices of a single subsystem has on other subsystems, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this article, an automated design approach is proposed with the aim of maximizing power density whilst minimizing total losses. As a vessel to investigate the presented optimization workflow, the magnetically coupled interleaved H-bridge topology is chosen as an emblematic example of multivariable design problem. The first step of this approach consists of developing a loss model of the converter, which takes into account components physical dimensions, the temperature dependence, and the circuit parasitics. In the second step, these models are used within a nested optimization procedure in order to estimate the losses for multiple points of load. With the aim of validating both design approach and optimization results, three different optimal solutions have been deeply analyzed with commercial suit, prototyped, and tested. The showed experimental results endorse the adopted design approach confirming the optimality/validity of the manufactured solutions.},

  abstract={In this paper, a checking system for eye lotion instillations of ophthalmology patients is proposed, using a neural network. It first estimates tilt angles of the eye dropper bottle from acceleration values measured by a triaxial sensor. A sequence of such estimated values is next presented to a discrimination model after network learning, and its output value is considered to be a certainty degree indicating whether an eye lotion is applied at the time zone corresponding to the sequence. The final judgement for the instillation is made by conducting thresholding of the certainty degree. The proposed method employs either a long short-term memory (LSTM for short) or a bidirectional long short-term memory (B_LSTM for short) to construct the discrimination model. Experimental results using practical data reveal that the B_LSTM-based model achieves favorable metric values compared to the LSTM-based model. In addition, it is explored whether the metric values depend on the interval between the time points when the tilt values are measured.},

  title={Computer Vision on the Edge: Individual Cattle Identification in Real-time with ReadMyCow System},

  abstract={In precision livestock farming, the individual identification of cattle is crucial to inform the decisions made to enhance animal welfare, health, and productivity. In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag’s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.},

  title={Battery-aware routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks},

  abstract={Recent technological advances have made it possible to support long lifetime and large volume streaming data transmissions in sensor networks. A major challenge is to maximize the lifetime of battery-powered sensors to support such transmissions. Battery, as the power provider of the sensors, therefore emerges as the key factor for achieving high performance in such applications. Recent study in battery technology reveals that the behavior of battery discharging is more complex than we used to think. Battery powered sensors might waste a huge amount of energy if we do not carefully schedule and budget their discharging. In this paper we study the effect of battery behavior on routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks. We first give an on-line computable energy model to mathematically model battery discharge behavior. We show that the model can capture and describe battery behavior accurately at low computational complexity and thus is suitable for on-line battery capacity computation. Based on this battery model we then present a battery-aware routing (BAR) protocol to schedule the routing in wireless sensor networks. The routing protocol is sensitive to the battery status of routing nodes and avoids energy loss. We use the battery data from actual sensors to evaluate the performance of our protocol. The results show that the battery-aware protocol proposed in this paper performs well and can save a significant amount of energy compared to existing routing protocols for streaming data transmissions. The network lifetime is also prolonged with maximum data throughput. As far as we know; this is the first work considering battery-awareness with an accurate analytical on-line computable battery model in sensor network routing. We believe our battery model can be used to explore other energy efficient schemes for wireless networks as well.},
