  abstract={Modeling of a phenomenon plays a key role in scientific thinking, and therefore an important issue in teaching science. Formulation of a model depends on methods to manipulate it. So far, differential equations have played a major role in scientific modeling because of model analysis using mathematics. However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.},

  abstract={This paper aims to explore the use of advanced resource retrieval algorithms under the framework of ecolinguistics theory, especially the KL-divergence retrieval model, to optimize the resource distribution and personalized learning path design of the English wisdom classroom system. Firstly, this paper introduces the basic concepts of ecolinguistics, emphasizing the dynamic and interactive nature of ecolinguistics learning. A CAELL framework combining the principles of ecolinguistics is proposed. The framework promotes students' acquisition of ecological language in interaction with computers by simulating the natural ecological language environment. Then, this paper analyzes the working mechanism of KL-divergence retrieval model, which can quantify the differences between different resources so as to accurately match students' learning needs. The research team constructed a prototype English wisdom classroom system and conducted a one-semester experiment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that students adopting CAELL technology and KL-divergence retrieval model were significantly better than those students adopting traditional teaching model in terms of vocabulary mastery, grammar application and oral communication. In addition, through the data mining and analysis of the learning process, the study also reveals the regularity of students' learning behavior, which provides a basis for further optimizing personalized learning strategies. The application of the computer-aided ecolingual learning technology and learning resource retrieval model in the intelligent English classroom system not only improves the teaching effect, but also provides a new way of thinking and practice for the future development of intelligent education.},

  abstract={The article explores the concept of knowledge and knowledge models concerning their application in evaluating the assimilation of methodological knowledge. It analyzes the benefits of employing test formats for assessment in the learning process and their influence on the enhancement of students’ critical thinking and analytical skills. The potential for automating the generation of test sets using computer technologies is investigated. A framework for formalizing problem scenarios based on ontology models is proposed, aiming to organize and generalize knowledge in this domain. A method for generating problem scenarios to assess methodological knowledge is developed, leveraging computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. This approach facilitates the creation of high-quality test sets with diverse tasks and scenarios, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of evaluating students’ knowledge. Through experimental research, a system of variable parameters is identified, enabling the customization of test sets to different student groups and educational contexts. The results obtained validate the efficacy of the proposed method and underscore its significance in enhancing the assessment and teaching of methodological knowledge in educational settings.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is a field within natural language processing that seeks to recognize and extract personal and emotional data from textual information, including feelings, viewpoints, and attitudes. Reviews have now turned into an indispensable data source for both consumers and businesses. Analyzing the sentiment of such reviews can offer valuable ideas into customers' likes, contentment, and discontentment. In recent times, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has paved new paths in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. In our work, sentiment of people is analyzed through reviews taken from people of various age groups from different educational backgrounds to understand the efficiency of ChatGPT. A comparative analysis was carried out by using four different machine learning models and two hybrid models using SVM + Decision Tree and Random Forest + Logistic Regression. The survey also analyzed various effects of using ChatGPT and how it contributes in making people lethargic and decreases logical thinking ability and problem-solving skills.},

  abstract={With the world becoming more and more reliant on technology, we are transitioning from a society that values rational evaluation over intuitive thinking to one in which both of those methods coexist. AI devices rely solely on rational evaluation and machine learning allows us to focus on intuition. The task of intelligence is to deduce which method should be relied upon when solving various problems via the establishment of realistic judgments, according to what kind it identifies as being best for that particular problem. However, human judgments cannot simply be quantitatively compared and ranked by a computer according to conditions set by algorithms because certain difficult-to-measure criteria are not easily passable through algorithm systems such as ethics and common sense. In this research, the authors focus on developing judgment classification models using random forest and support vector machine. The authors attempt to test the effectiveness of sentiment proportions as features in judgment classification models.},

  title={Investigating Persuasive Behaviors Across Different Opinion Polarities: A Study of Video Messages}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1176-1180},
  abstract={Interpreting subjectively what makes a person persuasive in online videos is a complex and dynamic process that requires critical thinking and active engagement from the part of the observer. With the rapid expansion of online communication through social networking websites, more persuasive content is made available online in the form of video. The use of positive and/or negative opinions might affect how persuasive someone appears to be. Persuasiveness is at the core of everyday human-human interactions, such as defending a client in a court, seeking a patient's compliance with medical advice or convincing a customer to buy a product. This study is motivated by the argument that persuasive behavior changes with opinion polarity and whether a speaker is trying to persuade one in favor of or against something. Emotion plays a key role in persuasion both in verbal and non-verbal communication, therefore understanding the impact of opinion polarity (sentiment) on the persuasive messages becomes increasingly important. The study aims to explain the” emotion” behind the message as expressed in negative and positive opinions both persuasive and unpersuasive videos. The data used for the analysis is derived from Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) dataset which is an online multimodal dataset with existing labels for persuasive and non-persuasive videos placed in two sentiment or opinion polarities (positive and negative). This research paper also introduced a new neuromarketing assessment method called NeuroMap's NeuroScoring tool, previously designed to evaluate persuasive messages through a neuromarketing perspective. The present study results align with the NeuroMap model's emphasis on the role of emotions in persuasion. The persuasion model suggests that emotions directly impact how people process and memorize information and how persuasive messages that evoke positive emotions are more likely to be effective. In the study, sentiment levels can be seen as indicators of emotional content conveyed in the video messages, and the positive relationship between sentiment levels and persuasiveness supports the view that emotional appeal plays a crucial role in influencing persuasion.},

  pages={1529-1542},
  abstract={Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior.},

  pages={87-102},
  abstract={A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from suicidal ideation. As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion release, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms of suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual&#x0027;s suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93&#x0025; accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, <i>post, personality,</i> and <i>experience</i> are the top-3 key indicators. Under these categories, <i>posted text</i>, <i>stress level</i>, <i>stress duration</i>, <i>posted image</i>, and <i>ruminant thinking</i> contribute to one&#x0027;s suicidal ideation detection.},

  abstract={In order to realize a cooperative supercomputing environment, Large-scale scientific simulation data should be exchanged among supercomputers over the internet. To maintain the interactivity of the time-series simulation in such an environment, real-time data compression is required. Given the accuracy requirements of scientific simulation, we only focus on lossless data compression. In this paper, we propose Think Mantissa as Integer method to decrease the entropy of scientific datasets, achieving a good compression ratio and speeds. We evaluate this scheme in two experiments and compare it with the existing compression strategies (gzip, bzip2). Our approach gets about a 30% improvement in the compression ratio and hundreds of times speed acceleration. We also computed the total time of the data transfer using this method under some specific bandwidth cases, and nearly all of them have gotten a good acceleration.},

  abstract={A reconstruction model of agile logistics was proposed in this paper, based on related agile and agile logistics research. At first, there was a short discussion about the agile logistics modular thinking and modular categories based on the operation of agile logistics processes, then the level of the customer service parameters and the functional modules of the logistics (transport, storage, distribution, package, etc) were analyzed by the antinomy relations between customer service and logistics cost, and then, the objective function of the reconstruction was identified. Secondly, the gray relational grade was used to acquire the result of decision-making result of the reconstruction model of agile logistics. At last, a real application was given for the model, calculated the gray relational grade and geted the best decision.},

  abstract={Creative problem solving model is a behavioral representation of users thinking, this kind of models helps to customize the user requirements to achieve a certain needs. Different studies have been reported the difficulties of learning in term of designing and developing a modern computer games applications which presents a complex activity by involving many participants from a variety of disciplines. Generally, developing a computer games is different from other types of software development because of video games include far more artistic content than other types of software systems, and there is many briers try to avoid other users or students who are willing to develop their own skills in this field. Hence, this research seeking for optimizing creative problem solving (CPS) model to help non programmers to learn how to design and develop computer games based framework. This research employed Virtools framework for providing an appropriate environment to design and develop computer games applications for non programmers.},

  abstract={Processes in the mind: perception, cognition, concepts, instincts, emotions, and higher cognitive abilities for abstract thinking, beautiful music are considered here within a neural modeling fields (NMFs) paradigm. Its fundamental mathematical mechanism is a process ¿from vague-fuzzy to crisp,¿ called dynamic logic (DL). This paper discusses why this paradigm is necessary mathematically, and relates it to a psychological description of the mind. Surprisingly, the process from ¿vague to crisp¿ corresponds to Aristotelian understanding of mental functioning. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements confirmed this process in neural mechanisms of perception.},

  abstract={A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.},
