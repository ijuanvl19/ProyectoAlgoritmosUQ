  abstract={Mobile learning is an inevitable result of technological progress, which is achieved through networks. Compared to traditional learning modes, using mobile phones for learning is not limited by geography or learning forms, and has great freedom in time and space. This is an informal remote teaching based on digitization and mobile computer devices. Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning. Based on the above issues, this article discussed how to build a mobile assisted language translation intelligent recommendation system using NPL (Natural Language Processing) technology. Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model. The experiment verified the superiority of the mobile assisted language translation system based on NPL.},

  abstract={In this study, we discuss a virtual agent's acquisition of orientational concepts based on physical experience. A virtual agent moves in a computer's virtual space under restrictions similar to that in the real world. We use a genetic algorithm to simulate and evolve the agent. We then discuss an orientational metaphor that has a basis in physical experience, and we attempt to retrieve clues for solving the generation of concepts by simulating concrete examples, for example, by detecting objects that build a pattern of leg locomotion to approach the object. The pattern is an insignificant set of weight matrices; however, this pattern is grounded in the environment and the body. We then discuss what is represented in the agent action by using the simulation results. In addition, we mention the construction of concepts, such as the GOOD-BAD concept.},

  pages={233-238},
  abstract={Music learning is important for preschool children’s musical development, but preschool children are considered to have limited cognitive development and have difficulties understanding abstract musical concepts. Tangible interaction can introduce physical entities into the interaction, allowing children to use their daily life experiences to interact with the computer, reducing the cognitive load and therefore improving the effectiveness of music learning. Combining the cognitive characteristics and physical ability level of preschool children, a design model of a music learning system for preschool children based on tangible interaction is constructed with reference to existing research models, and a set of design recommendations based on this model is proposed. This paper also designs and develops an interactive prototype Music Magician for preschool children to learn music and completes the construction of an interactive action library and iteration of the prototype after pre-experiment feedback. The validity of the prototype is verified through experiments, and the rationality of the proposed design model and design recommendations is also validated.},

  abstract={In research aimed at determining the level of interest of high school students in enrolling in colleges, predictive analysis models and comparisons are rarely applied during the classification and processing of various data. All of this leads to significant fluctuations in college admissions, where certain schools are unable to admit a large number of students who show interest in a specific field. On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields. The goal of this paper is to use programming language classifiers to predict student enrollments in colleges based on the results students demonstrate during regular attendance in high schools through participation in innovation fairs.},

  abstract={The South African government continuously strives to work on the development of legislations that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its citizen's information in the digital space. The contagion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) led to a global lockdown that put governments in emergency mode. Post-COVID-19, the benefits of digitization became more noticeable. During the lockdown era cloud computing proved its effectiveness and efficiency in helping employees continue working even outside of their workstations. The objective of this paper is to scrutinize the current state of cloud data protection in the public sector within South Africa. The emphasis is placed on the draft National policy for cloud and data storage. This paper also makes recommendations to further strengthen and improve the current state of South Africa's cloud and data storage. It goes further to review existing legislations such as POPI, ECT, and cyber law acts and their relevance to the draft National Data and Cloud Policy. A proposal for a model that incorporates the cloud-shared responsibility model is presented and briefly discussed.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.},

  abstract={Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.},

  abstract={The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \%$.},

  abstract={Educational simulations can be useful for visualization of abstract and complex concepts and semiconductor physics seems ideal for this type of instructional support. The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.},
