  pages={434-439},
  abstract={Creating background music based on vocal sounds using deep learning is challenging. The task involves multiple input and multiple output cases that require lengthy input and output as data. However, training the models with raw data using low-end computers is expensive since training takes a long time and requires high memory. Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.},

  pages={S4G-S4G},
  abstract={The commonly used programming approach in teaching computer graphics requires students to learn a lot before they can generate basic and not-so-realistic images. As a result, students may easily be lost in the jungle of programming primitives, and their high expectation fades away quickly. Moreover, the API based programming approach does not support global illumination models. To address these problems, a new approach that combines ray tracing and programming has been used in a junior level elective course, Introduction to Computing with Geometry, with great success. With ray tracing, we are able to cover the camera metaphor, basic shapes, geometric modeling, coefficients of an illumination model, light sources, textures, surface tessellation, smooth and nonsmooth triangles, and algebraic surfaces. A student can learn all the basics and generate beautiful and realistic looking images easily and quickly. This paper details our approach and presents our course materials, exercises, student work and evaluation.},

With the mentioned models, the signal fusion ideas are considered. With the development of general communication technology, audio AGC technology has also developed from analog circuits to the era of the digital signal processing. With these ideas, the digital online model for vocal music training will be then considered as the novel understanding model.

This study proposes a novel image editing method based on the Prompt-to-Prompt approach combined with large language models.

  abstract={Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.},

This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.},

  abstract={There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.},

  abstract={This paper discusses a tremendous change on the mode of computer application in the most industrial product design in China from computer-assisted mapping to computer aid design (CAD) with no paper, reviewing the development of the CAID and analyzing the status quo of the computer application mode. Combining the systematic process of industrial design, it researches into methods and process of the CAID, from the analysis of the computer aided product positioning, three-dimensional computer aided conceptual design, CNC processing and rapid prototyping.},

  abstract={In this study, we aimed to address issues related to students' slow writing skills by incorporating the “Out of Eden Walk” project using an AI model. Employing a project-based learning approach, our goal was to enhance students' writing abilities, particularly in the English subject. The research was conducted as a part of the classroom term-end assessment, following the model established by Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology, involving 42 students from Class 11. We utilized a qualitative descriptive method, employing both test and non-test instruments, including observation and data analysis in six cycles. The initial student completion rate was only 11.42%, while the experimental group showed a significant improvement to 85.71% by the end of the study. National Geographic's Out of Eden Walk, led by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, serves as an exemplary illustration of slow journalism. Over a seven-year, around-the-world journey, this article explores how Salopek's Walk not only embodies the essence of slow journalism but also significantly contributed to enhancing students' writing skills through the integration of an AI model.},
