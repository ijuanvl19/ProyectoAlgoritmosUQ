  abstract={In order to enable students to obtain more effective and reliable modeling scheme in the stage of product modeling deliberation, a set of product modeling design program suitable for classroom teaching is constructed based on the method of finite structure analysis (FSM). Firstly, the product main function system is decomposed into several secondary functions by the method of limited structure analysis, and the secondary functions are re-structured and the spatial layout is changed to deduce a variety of modeling schemes. Then, combining with clay model making method, the details of the obtained scheme are deliberated, and then the most reliable design scheme is obtained through comprehensive and objective evaluation and screening by PUGH decision matrix method. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the above methods are verified by the example of the vaneless fan modelling research, which provides support for students to use rational thinking in product modelling design.},

  pages={350-355},
  abstract={During the early design explorations, designers and architects tend to treat freehand sketching as a mirror of their mind. The spontaneity of conventional sketching is undoubtedly important for the designer's thinking process. CAD systems and the contrived interfaces do not offer the advantage that sketching does. Can modern technology offer a tool that the designers would readily accept for their creative explorations? The study is based on a visualization of a hypothetical system, where the designer develops a representation of 3D shapes of reasonable complexity, sitting in front of a terminal. Using his gestures and limited speech, he inputs into the computer an online representation of shape. This feedback is available to the designer live on his monitor. The experiments reported test this hypothetical system using simulation. Gestures involve spatial movements and they could be more convenient tools for the designers to express spatial ideas. Keeping modeling of shapes in the computer during the act of design as a focus of this study, this paper aims to identify the potentials and limitations of the natural gestures as a source of shape information.},

In order to expand the thinking of students in the external cultivation class and improve their ability to analyze and solve complex mechanical problems, the research team supplemented the finite element theory for the students in their spare time and introduced the working principle of ABAQUS software. Aiming at the problem of stress and deformation of special-shaped parts proposed by students, the finite element model was established and simulation calculation was carried out by a computer. The simulation results intuitively and clearly show the stress and strain of special-shaped parts, and solve the students’ doubts. The teaching feedback results show that the expansion of finite element theory based on mechanical analysis and the application of ABAQUS software have played an important role in the following three aspects: 1) expanding students’ vision (100%); 2) improving students’ interest in learning (100%); 3) improving the relationship between teachers and students (90.9%).},

  abstract={In the present study we call attention to the close connection between languages and globalization and we emphasize the importance of the Internet and online websites in foreign language teaching and learning as unavoidable elements of computer assisted language learning (CALL). Most of the educators can notice the traditional teacher-centered teaching model has been unable to cater for the present situation of College English teaching and learning. The arrival and the development of computers and the Internet offer a turning point in English learning methodology. Promoting student's autonomy in English learning has become an urgent task. What EFL teachers in China need to do now is to modernize English teaching and combine the new with the old so as to adapt the communicative approach to traditional teaching structures. The level-based college English teaching model combined with information technology can not only facilitate the cultivation of professional teachers with teaching proficiency and researching potential but also develop students' creative thinking, promote the students' cross-cultural awareness and strengthen the emotional communication as well. Teachers can utilize the network resources to provide students with a rich visual learning reference, which caters for classroom teaching, students' self-learning and improves teaching efficiency. College English teaching practice needs continued exploration and innovation, the accumulation of teaching experience to receive the best teaching results. However, the effects of such teaching model still depend on program design, classroom management and adequate support from administrators, technicians, teachers and learners themselves.},

  abstract={According to Aebli's operative method (1963) and Bruner's (1974) theory of representation the development of the process of thinking in teaching has the following phases - levels of abstraction: manipulation with specific things (specific phase), iconic representation (figural phase), symbolic representation (symbolic phase). Modern information technology has contributed to the enrichment of teaching and learning processes, especially in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics and those of production and technology. Simulation appears as a new possibility in the representation of knowledge. According to Guetzkow (1972) simulation is an operative representation of reality from a relevant aspect. It is about a model of an objective system, which is dynamic in itself. If that model is material it is a simple simulation, if it is abstract it is a reflective experiment, that is a computer simulation. This present work deals with the systematization and classification of simulation methods in the teaching of natural sciences and mathematics and of production and technology with special retrospective view on computer simulations and exemplar representation of the place and the role of this modern method of cognition.},

  title={A Nifty Inter-Class Peer Learning Model for Enhancing Student-Centered Computing Education, and for Generating Student Interests in Co-Curricular Professional Development}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This Work-In-Progress paper in the Innovative Practice Category presents an innovative model of inter-class peer collaboration that enhances student learning in computing education, and addresses student conceptual gaps. It expands the scope of traditional peer learning beyond the usual classroom setting and motivates student creativity leading to interests in co-curricular professional development. This nifty peer learning model connects computing students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class, so that they can aid each other in a mentor-mentee relationship to address conceptual learning gaps. Existing literature on computing educational research show that several peer learning models have been used in a typical classroom setting for reinforcing learning. However, very few peer learning models have been used in an inter-class setting, and none have been driven by student conceptual gaps in order to create an enhanced learning environment. Our model focuses on developing student interests in further co-curricular professional development opportunities in the form of peer mentoring, tutoring and instruction. Currently, student retention is a significant challenge for computing educators, given the demand of the computing disciplines for an all-round solid knowledge base, including grasping of complex technical concepts. Our approach of inter-class peer collaboration strengthens the learning environment of both lower level and upper level computing courses, and provides much needed support to students, whose knowledge base is still underdeveloped and conceptual understanding is undercooked. This unique form of inter-class peer learning provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps by mentoring lower level students. It also enables the lower level students to receive peer guidance for addressing their conceptual gaps. Our improvised peer networking model adds a different dimension to the practice of intra-class peer learning and extends peer learning beyond the traditional bounds. It promotes a new kind of service learning project in classes by encouraging peer mentoring that leads to peer connections across classes. It aids student retention by helping lower level student mentees get over their knowledge limitations. Our work-in-progress research case study indicates that this model inspires peer mentors to engage in out-of-box thinking by challenging them to find creative ways for overcoming conceptual shortcomings of mentees. This, in turn, generates student interests in enhanced co-curricular professional development. Additionally, our ongoing experimental study results show that this model can help in producing a sustainable pool of peer mentors, tutors and teaching assistants, who can become resources plus role-models for other students, and for helping student retention. As part of our in-progress experiments, this model has been deployed within our computer programming classes, where CS2 students have been paired with CS1 students based upon conceptual gaps and knowledge shortcomings. As we conduct these teaching experiments, we analyze the performance of our model through data obtained by conducting student surveys. We discuss these initial collected data and cite them as preliminary evidence in the process of evaluating our model in terms of the improved learning, and generated student interests plus engagement in professional development.},

We consider that Blender is useful not only as a virtual simulator and visualization tool, but also a modeling design tool of object that we need in real experimentation. This paper also presents two examples of simulations by Blender for physics and computer algorithm education, in which one simulates for the movement of a horizontally thrown ball and another for well-known “Tower of Hanoi”. The programming of “Tower of Hanoi” requires the understanding of recursive procedure that is important mathematical thinking in programming. We consider that the utilization of Blender will be promising for the proposed two-sided method of STEM education.},

  abstract={As the utility marketplace continues to evolve, long-term survival and prosperity require clear, strategic thinking on the enterprise transforming initiatives needed to effectively increase efficiency and improve revenue opportunities. After a vision is formulated or refined, one of the crucial steps to be undertaken involves a business-process modeling exercise aimed at determining the operational processes that will support the strategy. In many cases, business-process automation (integrating information across systems) serves as the foundation for an enterprise business-process model. Adapting a modern business-process model includes embracing change. Toward that end, enterprise-application integration (EAI), the nimble strategy that involves technology and process that enables disparate systems to exchange business-level information in languages that each understands, provides the backbone infrastructure for implementing a business-process model. Ultimately, EAI serves as the enabler of high-level strategies detailed out as part of a business-process modeling effort and provides the flexible framework to address changing business climates.},

  abstract={In traditional teaching models, the role of teachers is relatively singular. Teachers are the controllers of the classroom, and students spend less than 10% of their time speaking English besides being asked to answer questions. Therefore, it is difficult for teachers to become promoters, facilitators, or coordinators of students' learning. Therefore, this article conducts research on the intelligent new mode design through the organic integration of computer networks and EL T (English Language Teaching) courses. When designing teaching activities, we should pursue the mutual promotion between the application of information technology and the transformation of teaching methods. Through the comprehensive application of information technology and various activity methods, information technology can not only support existing teaching methods, but also promote the transformation of teaching methods. Through the analysis of the research results indicating the weekly learning volume of EL T courses, it can be found that only a few students consider it easy, while the majority of students believe that the course volume is large, with an average proportion of up to 52.11 %. It can be seen that students can only engage in effective communication between students and teachers on the basis of self-learning and understanding, and their creative thinking can be effectively improved during the learning process.},

Through data mining, we can realize the market positioning of enterprises, the positioning of consumer groups, and help to formulate automobile marketing strategies. With the rapid development of data mining technology, diversified data show its important business value. Based on data mining technology, this paper analyzes how to change the automobile marketing mode, aiming to make the healthy development of China's automobile marketing mode, so as to make China continue to develop and expand the automobile sales market.},

  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism for computer generated forces (CGF). The proposed CGF can take actions similar to a human pilot to gain an advantageous status over the enemy target using the intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism. The mechanism will produce the best multi-step tactics combination (MSTC) for the CGF in an air combat environment. The MSTC is composed of CGF’s decision space. In this paper, based on our previous work, we propose a predictive multi-step fuzzy inference system (PMSFIS) as the automatic maneuvering mechanism for CGF, which incorporates and mimics human thinking capability and the maximum capacity of CGF. Before PMSFIS executes the fuzzy inference system (FIS) process, it will generate a list of MSTC, and allows CGF to predict its future posture corresponding to the list of MSTC. This paper assumes that CGF can accurately predict an enemy target’s future position, then PMSFIS applies the predicted data to generate the best MSTC. We verify the proposed algorithm with a set of fighter flying data that is used as the enemy target’s flying trajectory. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows that PMSFIS will enable CGF to obtain the best status in an air combat environment and improve the performance of our previous work.},

  abstract={Average students are satisfied with the learning obtained through the activities indicated in the course program. It is necessary to innovate in the educational process so that students find more meaning in their learning process, incorporating the experience of similar situations in the workplace, motivating a constant improvement and stimulating the development of creative thinking for the solution of problems.Research suggests that when teachers challenge students with problems according to reality, it increases confidence and motivation for learning in them.In the present work, we share the experience of incorporating a “challenge” in the Analysis and Design of Algorithms course, where through the simulation of a job interview of a software development company, students are motivated to work “an extra time”.},
