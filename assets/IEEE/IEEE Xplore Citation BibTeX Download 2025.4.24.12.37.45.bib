  abstract={In the era of digital intelligence, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational practices has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods. Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

  abstract={Abstract rules can be learned by several species (not only humans). We propose a biologically plausible model for same/different discrimination, that can point towards the neural basis of abstract concept learning. By including a neural adaptation mechanism to a discriminator model formerly introduced in the literature, selective clusters of neurons fire depending on whether or not the stimuli compared are the same or not. These selective neurons are consistent with experimental findings in the literature. Moreover, reward and attention can modulate the relative strength of each attribute/feature of the stimulus, so more complex abstract discriminations can be achieved using the proposed model as a building block. As a formal model, it can be easily incorporated into several applications in robotics and intelligent machines.},

  abstract={This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},

However, it remains debatable about the content or curriculum of computing as a separate subject or as an integral part of all other subjects. A literature study reveals that most of the current high school education focuses on computer as a separate subject and less emphasis on computing and its integration with other subjects. The present work intends to propose a conceptual approach “Computing Implementation for High School Curriculum” with an objective of integrating computing as a part high school education with a multi-dimensional approach. It includes teaching & learning, emphasis on problem solving and supporting academic administration. This can help the stakeholders in the field of education to improve the overall development of our future generation.},

  abstract={A formal theory for abstract concepts and knowledge manipulation is created by Wang recently known as concept algebra. Concept algebra is an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment of concepts and their algebraic relations, operations, and associative rules for composing complex concepts, which provides a denotational mathematic means for knowledge system representation and manipulation. This paper presents a method that shows how the theory of concept algebra is implemented and simulated using typical computers. A visualized knowledge representation tool for concept algebra is developed, which enables machines learn concepts and knowledge autonomously. Nine forms of concept association operations are implemented in the tool to rigorously manipulate knowledge by concept networks. The knowledge representation tool is capable to present concepts and knowledge systems in multiple ways, in order to visualize concept networks by computer simulations.},

The questionnaire is designed from four dimensions: learning motivation, teaching methods, learning methods and learning effects. The results of the questionnaire show that the reasons for the lack of deep learning of computer basic courses are as follows: lack of novel content, too large class size, uneven basic level of students, only shallow learning for examinations and single evaluation method. The conclusion is introducing the teaching concept of deep learning into computer basic courses can change the teaching paradigm for the purpose of knowledge transfer and enable students to deeply participate in and effectively experience learning.},

Firstly, some concepts of cloud model theory and grey relational analysis were introduced and an improved forward cloud generator was put forward to normalize the decision matrix of TOPSIS, thus the uncertainty of the decision data was embodied and simulated. Then the steps of the improved TOPSIS were described. The calculation method of the numerical characteristics of the cloud model used to normalize the decision matrix was given. The separation to the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution was calculated by grey relational analysis method which can reflect the trend relationship between the alternative and the ideal solution. The weight of the criteria was calculated on the basis of the exponential scale of analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can provide more evaluation information by its statistical nature.},

  pages={700-706},
  abstract={Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.},

  abstract={Processes are everywhere. Organizations have business processes to manufacture products, provide services, purchase goods, handle applications, etc. Also in our daily lives we are involved in a variety of processes, for example when we use our car or when we book a trip via the Internet. Although such operational processes are omnipresent, they are at the same time intangible. Unlike a product or a piece of data, processes are less concrete because of their dynamic nature. However, more and more information about these processes is captured in the form of event logs. Contemporary systems ranging from copiers and medical devices to enterprise information systems and cloud infrastructures record events. These events can be used to make processes visible. Using process mining techniques it is possible to discover processes. This provides the insights necessary to manage, control, and improve processes. Process mining has been successfully applied in a variety of domains ranging from healthcare and e-business to high-tech systems and auditing. Despite these successes, there are still many challenges as process discovery shows that the real processes are more "spaghetti-like" than people like to think. It is still very difficult to capture the complex reality in a suitable model. Given the nature of these challenges, techniques originating from Computational Intelligence may assist in the discovery of complex processes.},

  abstract={Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$f∘g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even “well-mixedness”, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.},
