  abstract={In order to keep up with the computer science development and national informationization, basic computer education has been deeply reformed in domestic college. After investigating the present situation of basic computer education and its reformation, a new reformatting scheme is proposed. Basic computer education in college should be promoted to information technology literacy education, which students’ information technology literacy and practice ability will be strengthened. In this scheme, the teaching process is divided into three stages: basic information technology literacy education, application ability of information technology literacy education, information technology literacy of specialty education. And modularized courses are prepared for students in each stage. The detail of corresponding lecture and experiment curricula system is also researched.},

  abstract={This paper scrutinizes the structure of jump-controlled LFSRs for resistance against generalized correlation attack based upon Constrained Levenshtein Distance(CLD) measure. It proves that for a given number of cipher text bits, CLD computation is independent of Jump index. However, based upon the inherent relation between the jump index and deletion rate, it is argued that structures utilizing primitive polynomials with large values of jump indices are relatively safer against generalized correlation attack when compared with their counterparts. The paper also presents a novel recursive algorithm for efficient computation of CLD for jump controlled structures and another algorithm to defeat the complexity induced due to high deletion rates.},

  abstract={Every society has its own characteristics, shaped from time to time by the various innovative, disruptive, but in any case, dynamically changing mechanisms that affect it most. In today's society, technological innovation plays a major role in the development of individuals and their abilities. Education is the most typical and obvious arena for shaping, developing, and preparing for the challenges of the future. As in the leading sectors, in the world of education, rapid responses and immediate reactions to change significantly increase the ability to achieve and maintain success and thus marketability. As a sector responsible for developing the competences of individuals, building knowledge and training professionals, education should seek to keep pace with trends and break with traditional approaches and methods, so that, in addition to incorporating technological developments, a renewed approach to organizational development and methodology is an important means of achieving the desired success and effectiveness. In the course of our work, we provide a summary insight into the project work of student groups who require up-to-date IT skills, use advanced IT tools, plan, and implement their web development workflows supported by database management, front-end planning and design, and back-end programming with a project management approach according to the latest trends, interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of working methods for success.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made remarkable advances across various domains, capturing the interest of researchers, also in the fields of signal processing and speech enhancement (SE). This growing of attention has led to numerous studies focusing on developing and improving models for SE. One of the persistent challenges in the area is in designing a lightweight model (in terms of memory and computation requirements) that still delivers satisfactory results in terms of sound quality. In this paper, we present a lightweight, DNN-based SE model that offers significantly less computations than the current state-of-the-art SE models. By following a step-by-step approach, we re-evaluate the impact of various parts of typical SE models revealing the trade-offs between speech quality and computational costs. Assuming a single-core, 200MHz microcontroller device, our SE model can achieve real-time SE performance (less than 3M Multiply-Accumulate operations, MACs) with a small degradation in SE capabilities compared to state-of-the-art SE models.},

  pages={1528-1533},
  abstract={Its use in literary criticism might be one of the most novel opportunities to analyze texts and themes since artificial intelligence (AI) touches and improves every facet of human life. This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but evaluating their quality remains an open challenge. Existing automated metrics like FID are unable to fully capture generation performance across both objective fidelity and subjective aesthetic attributes important to human perception. This paper conducts an extensive review of the literature on GAN evaluation methodology. Key limitations of current approaches are analyzed through a discussion of popular metrics and their inability to predict human judgment comprehensively. To address this, a novel hybrid evaluation model is proposed that combines automated scores with human ratings to provide a more balanced assessment. A pilot study demonstrates the hybrid metric can predict human response more accurately.},

This research demonstrates fast and viable ways to build such models in operational environments. Through social network extraction from texts, network analytics to identify key actors, and then simulation to assess alternative interventions, advisors can support practicing and execution of crisis de-escalation activities. We describe how we used this approach as part of a scenario-driven modeling effort. We demonstrate the strength of moving from data to models and the advantages of data-driven simulation, which allow for iterative refinement.

To address and realize the benefits of liking UML, automata and formal methods, our project on "formalization of UML diagrams" is in progress. This paper is continuation of the same project in which behavior diagrams namely use case, activity and state diagrams are selected for critical analysis and possible improvements. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the diagrams are addressed. Finally, a treatment is suggested to link UML diagrams with nondeterministic and parallel finite automata to enhance modeling power of UML for facilitating the software development procedures.},

  abstract={Trying to be effective (no matter who exactly and in what field) a person face the problem which inevitably destroys all our attempts to easily get to a desired goal. The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.},

  abstract={The term "Modern Art Teaching and Evaluation Model" describes the systematic incorporation of creative practices, methods, and experiences into traditional academic curricula in order to improve student achievement across the curriculum. The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education. The simulation results demonstrate the system's superior performance in precision, accuracy, efficiency, productivity, learning score, and student performance score.},

  abstract={Personalized learning is a teaching method that tailors learning to each student's specific talents, requirements, abilities, and preferences in order to foster entrepreneurial skills. In personalized education, each student is given a curriculum based on what they already know and how well they understand. To achieve its rapid and productive activity, a large-scale data analysis model for tracking the creative and entrepreneurial skills of college students is dependent on the balance and synergy of aspects such as different learning, finance, and institutional frameworks. As a result, in this research, a Big Data-assisted Thinking Skill Analysis Model (BD-TSAM) is presented to analyze students' innovative thinking skills and improve entrepreneurial skills through tailored education. This study creates a sophisticated and varied learning resource that continuously records and analyses student data. It provides tailored training, personalized learning, and dependable real-time services through technical support that uses big data to increase Entrepreneurship abilities. BD-TSAM enhances students' distinctive social and autonomous entrepreneurship learning by providing adaptive learning services. BD-TSAM intelligently creates a learning paradigm that is appropriate for each student and actually implements tailored learning for instilling entrepreneurial abilities. Comparing the suggested BD-TSAM model to other models already in use, the experimental results demonstrate that it increases the student learning rate by 94.6%, assessment rate by 95.2%, F-measure ratio by 96.6%, student performance ratio by 98.1%, decision-making rate by 99.1%, and employment ratio by 98.9%.},

In addition, effective communication, teamwork, and problem solving are important skills for graduate engineers in their professional work. This study proposes Creative Problem Solving as a framework to improve the way engineering students learn mathematics and support their critical problem solving, communication, and team working skills. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using creative problem solving skills through blended learning environment as seen from an Engineering Mathematics students' perspective. First year undergraduate students participated in an experimental group where instruction was provided in a blended learning format using a creative problem solving approach. The lecturer then used face-to-face instruction on the same subject to a control group. Results indicate that from the perspective of the students in the experimental group, the ability to utilize creative problem solving skills is the most important skill set when learning Engineering Mathematics.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming-programming by end users with limited or even no formal programming background-is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Conversational Programming, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to help end-users visualize discrepancies between the programs they intended to write and their actual programming results.},

  abstract={In the Northern Appalachian region around Pittsburgh, PA, many high schools do not have computer science courses, so students are not introduced to this critical subject that is needed for most technical career paths. Our unique strategy is to invite current high school science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers, in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Maryland, to participate in 3 summer workshops showing how to incorporate computing concepts into existing STEM courses. By working with teachers on how to assimilate programming and computational thinking into their classrooms we will effectively reach a large population of students in areas where computer science classes are not available. In this paper, we outline the current state of the project and some of the data we have collected. Future goals for this project include performing a rigorous evaluation of teacher impact and developing the workshop materials for wider dissemination.},
