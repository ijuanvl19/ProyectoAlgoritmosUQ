  abstract={In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Adaptive Brain-Inspired Emotional Decayed Learning named Fuzzy ADBEL. Fuzzy ADBEL is a computational model that models the forgetting process and inhibitory mechanism of the emotional brain. In the model, the fuzzy decay rate simulates the forgetting process, and the stimulus and learning weights are considered as fuzzy variables trained by fuzzy learning rules. The final output of the model is evaluated by a fuzzy decision making layer that simulates the inhibitory mechanism. The proposed Fuzzy ADBEL is utilized to predict the Kp, AE and Dst indices showing opposite behaviors and characterizing the chaotic activity of the earth's magnetosphere. Experimental results show that fuzzy approaches including Fuzzy ADBEL and ANFIS (Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System) reaches steady state faster than non-fuzzy approaches, ADBEL and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Hence, we hope the proposed model can be used in real time chaotic time series prediction.},

  pages={178938-178945},
  abstract={The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility.},

  abstract={This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.},

  abstract={This WIP exposes the design and implementation of Midroid, an open mobile platform focused on microcontrollers' education. The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers; area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform.},

Next, we focus on designing an integrated intelligent government (IIG) by partitioning a government's structure into different intelligent agents which use diverse knowledge bases and inference methodologies.

  abstract={The power systems of the future - smart grids - will see an increase in both renewable energy sources and load demand, thus increasing the need for fast dynamic reconfiguration of system parameters to handle energy and load dispatches. Power systems will need to be monitored continuously to maintain stability under normal and abnormal operating conditions and when facing disturbances. A combination of system state prediction, dynamic power flow, system optimization, and solution stability checking will allow for a more reliable, affordable, efficient and clean power grid. The optimization and control systems on a smart grid will require a computational systems thinking capability to handle the uncertainties and variability that exist in a smart grid environment. The concept of sense-making based on computational intelligence methods, including neural networks, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, as well as online measurements from a smart grid to provide `situational' awareness in the context of stability, is introduced in this paper.},

  title={Grammar Instruction with UML}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={934-940},
  abstract={Globally, women account for a small percentage of students and professionals in ICT-related fields. In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.},

  abstract={Implementing a virtual production system is challenging. Production systems are constrained by different dynamical market changes and characterised by complex general and machine specific interactions, uncertainties and unknowns. These complications make predicting the behaviour by any deterministic computer model not only inaccurate but sometimes misleading, e.g. if the range of a model's applicability is not sufficiently well identified. Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence. The theory of design oriented thinking adapted for manufacturing favours fast iteration in digitised design cycles instead of optimisation of model quality in one step.},

  abstract={Denial and wishful thinking are well known affective phenomena that influence human belief processes. Put simply, they consist of tendencies to disbelieve what one would not like to be true, and believe what one would like to be true. We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.},
