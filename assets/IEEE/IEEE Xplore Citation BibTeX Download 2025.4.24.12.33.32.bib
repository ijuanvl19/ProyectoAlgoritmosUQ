  abstract={Construction of audit internal control intelligent system based on Blockchain and cloud storage is conducted in this paper. At present, the development of artificial intelligence in various fields is getting better and better, and the artificial intelligence information technology is slowly beginning to converge towards the auditing field. The blockchain storage application system requires each node to store a complete data, causing waste of the storage resources; at the same time, it does not make full use of the network routing traffic resources. Based on this background, this paper proposes the novel AI and BC based intelligent system for the audit internal control. The system is designed and validated through the simulation. The proposed intelligent system can improve the overall efficiency.},

  abstract={The K-12 ICT (Information and Communication Technology) curriculum in Taiwan faced many changes in last two decades. In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.},

  abstract={We detail the design, implementation, and an initial evaluation of a virtual reality education and entertainment (edutainment) application called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.},

  abstract={The "Bebras" is an international large scale contest that aims to motivate children for engaging in Computer Science. In this paper we present an investigation of the psychometric factors that determine the success in this contest, e.g. Abilities in Computational Thinking or intelligence factors. For this purpose, we looked for subsets of Bebras questions that are requiring joint psychometric constructs, according to the responses of the test persons, applying latent trait analysis on all combinations of questions. After identifying suitable sets of questions, we tested the fit of the mono-parametric Rasch Model and evaluated the distribution of person parameters. Additionally, the identified sets of questions were analyzed by qualitative methods to find out the nature of these common psychometric constructs. As a test bed for feasibility studies, we have chosen the Bebras Contests of Germany 2009. We have found and analyzed several sets of questions that met our requirements, analyzed the questions, and identified differences in the performance of boys and girls in these sets.},

  abstract={Some researchers consider that the benefits of Computational Thinking (CT) in education are unclear, and therefore a quantitative study to understand the effects of CT skills in the basic levels of formal education is needed. The present study aims to analyze the effects of CT on the academic performance of students in high school. We seek to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Can CT increase the problem-solving skills of students in high school? (RQ2) Is CT related to the performance of students in high school? (RQ3) Can CT improve the performance of students in high school? We conducted an analysis between two groups of students with similar profiles belonging to the same population, where the factor CT proficiency is the only feature that distinguishes both groups. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between the performance of evaluated students and their skills of CT developed by computer programming. In addition, we found that students proficient in computer programming have superior performance up to 10.2% in ENEM (National Exam of High School) assessment compared to those with little or no experience level and even better performance 21% in the WASI test problem-solving in students on attending high school.},

  abstract={This research full paper characterizes the literature on academic initiatives to foster computational thinking and programming (CT&P) in Brazilian K-12 education. Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CT&P in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CT&P in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper investigates the effect of Computational Thinking (CT) and robotics on learning mathematics. CT involves problem-solving skills based on Computer Science concepts. However, there is no CT formal definition as well as information on how to integrate it with other high school subjects. Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.},

  abstract={This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.},

  abstract={In the past, many investigations focused on the impact of programming skills towards learning computational thinking (CT). However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.},

  abstract={In present study the fractal theory has been reviewed in the context of bio-functional and biomedical complex systems. The chaotic approach is a critical component of the theoretical framework and can be used in analyzing complex biological structures such as chromatin structures. Fractality is a metric of complexity in biological functions; it is an indicator of the complication level of the self-similar structure, while chaos is a sort of dynamic behavior that usually produces totally arbitrary patterns. Fractal measurements in vivo could be used to predict the efficiency of painful therapy. The fractal technique can be used to assess carcinogenesis, tumor progression, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment with the convergence of modern sensing techniques in nano-scale spectroscopic techniques, which is a prospective biomarker. The mathematical principles of fractals and chaos in biological systems are presented in the context of the condition of health treatment and their significance. Fractality in different biological functions including the heart has now been investigated and measured the dosing quantity with chaos and fractal level. As excessive amounts of chaos and fractal complexity are harmful to biological predictions. For biological applications, chaos analysis may be advantageous. This paper is a review which highlights the fractal and chaos theories for biological functions and biomedical systems. The focus will be to explore biological functions, due to its computational machine learning-based demands and capability in mathematical complexity.},

  abstract={Recent basic studies reveal that novel solutions to fundamental AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the maturity of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. The latest discovery in knowledge science by Wang revealed that the basic unit of knowledge is a binary relation (bir) as that of bit for information and data. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from those of deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by cognitive systems. Fundamental theories and novel technologies for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra and inference algebra.},

Any AI project can get a score from SustainAlign for how sustainable it is. This number shows how long the project will last by looking at how it will affect the world and how many resources it will use. EthixScan computes the ethical commitment score to assess the ethical nature of AI solutions, taking into account their openness and bias levels. InnoMerge assigns an Innovation Catalyst Score to AI projects that integrate important goals to generate new ones. The final Cross-Synergy score is determined by adding the marks for innovation, ethics, and the environment. We find the best AI project pairs by using a multi-objective optimization method that takes into account limited resources and raises the overall cross-synergy score.},

Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.},

  abstract={In this paper, we compare and analyze the prediction performance of existing ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) models. The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant.},

  abstract={Color harmony is an important factor affecting the aesthetic feeling of images and plays an important role in visual perception. It can evaluate the feasibility of images by constructing the computational model of human aesthetic thinking. In this paper, a color harmony evaluation method based on color complexity was implemented. Given the classical color harmony model which is suitable for the simple color combination but not suitable for the complex image, and the local feature redundancy caused by grid sampling, an adaptive sampling based on CCM(color complexity measure) was implemented. Then, K-means was adopted to extract local color harmony features. Finally, a model was constructed between local color harmony features and the overall color harmony by SVM. The results show that the method implemented in this paper can represent the color harmony of complex images accurately and effectively.},

  abstract={It is proper that to evaluate algorithm's performance using statistics for stochastic search optimization such as PSO. In this paper, we do performance statistics and analysis for some different situation taking Rosen Brock function as example, from statistics we think that local model is better than global model in avoiding premature, and neighborhood size is not important, number of particles should be enough large to distributed as uniformly as possible in search space, and the same times it should smaller than iteration times to complete information flow among particles. Based on this statistics we present a weighted PSO model, test result shows that our model's performance is better than basic PSO model.},

  abstract={The ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar plays an important role in surveillance, precision tracking, and classification of ground moving targets. The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost.},
