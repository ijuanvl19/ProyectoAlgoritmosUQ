  abstract={This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.},

  abstract={Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.},

  abstract={STEAM education has been paid much attention currently for fostering the interdisciplinary thinking abilities. However, the current learning content of STEAM almost focuses on the learning of STEM subjects and the cultivation of the Computational Thinking (CT), so the learning of ART subject is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Scheme of STEAM Interactive Learning Toy for Musical Thinking (MT) and Computational Thinking (ILT-MCT), to engage primary level elementary students in learning knowledge and concepts of the MT and CT both. In ILT-MCT scheme, children read the paper-based learning content (learning book) to learn the concepts of MT and CT, interact with a Mobile-based learning toy using substantial Programming Blocks, and further play the digital game-based learning content via the learning toy to enhance the learning motivation.},

We review the theoretical background and demonstrate the basis upon which an interactive counterpart can be achieved in supporting the cognitive capabilities of the designer, such as visual thinking. The approach is elaborated and illustrated by experimental work in the area of conceptual design. We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.},

  abstract={Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.},

Video scenarios present problems in the context of lifelike settings in order to emphasize the complexity as well as creative potential presented by problems which are diverse, multi-layered and frequently ill-defined. Students must carefully observe and critically listen to the characters in the videos in order to understand the problems they are experiencing. Through discussion, design or implementation, students explore potential ways in which computing can be used to help the characters solve their problems. The approach is designed to develop creative problem solving skills, while also encouraging students to view themselves as capable of entrepreneurship and innovation in computing.

Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts.

  abstract={With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.},

In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.},

Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.},

  abstract={In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.},

  abstract={Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

  abstract={Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is the systematic approach of defining a problem and crafting its solution. It employs computer programming algorithms to address scientific, engineering, and mathematical challenges using programming languages. Feedback plays a pivotal role in the learning journey of computational thinking. It is widely recognized that offering timely feedback to students on their computational endeavors significantly contributes to their achievement and overall satisfaction with the course. This research explores the implementation of an automated feedback system designed to evaluate and offer early feedback on computer engineering projects. The aim is to integrate best practices and software tools related to computational thinking into the thinking and learning processes within an engineering curriculum. Preliminary findings suggest that the automated feedback system enhances students' computational skills and improves their performance in the course. We anticipate that the insights gained from this research will inform the enhancement of curricula and course evaluations across different computational thinking tasks, disciplines, and courses.},

However, providing appropriate early CT learning opportunities can potentially help learners develop both interest and self-efficacy in computer science and STEM fields.Our research aims to characterize computational thinking and engineering thinking for K-2 aged children. In this paper, we report on our findings of children exploring a recently installed exhibit at a local Midwestern science center. The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.},

  abstract={This Research to practice work in progress paper explores teachers' experiences about a professional development program focused on discipline-based computational thinking (CT). The goal of the program is to integrate computational practices into disciplinary learning environments at the K-12 level in Colombia. To promote this integration and to explore teachers' conceptions and possible scenarios to integrate CT in this context, the research team designed, implemented, and assessed a 20-hour professional development program with 21 teachers from public middle and high schools in Antioquia, Colombia. The program introduced the concepts and practices of CT and discussed why these are relevant for students to learn. A use-modify-create instructional sequence was used as the pedagogical approach to scaffold participants' learning process. At the end of the workshop, the teachers completed a survey regarding their experience in the program. Preliminary results indicate that the participating teachers increased their knowledge and interest to integrate computational thinking practices into their disciplinary learning environments.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking was an important way to study computer science and it explained the relationships between human, calculation and computer in terms of thinking. The computer science was raised from the theory of tools to the height of thinking. This paper introduced three levels of Computational Thinking: Computational Thinking in computer science, Computational Thinking in computing science and Computational Thinking in all subjects and analyzed the thinking characteristic of calculation and the calculation attribute of thinking. Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics. The paper thought the goal of teaching was not to learn knowledge itself, but to form problem solving thinking.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, also called structural thinking is characterized by design and construction. In view of the existing problems of traditional teaching methods in high vocational colleges, we propose a teaching method aimed at developing the computational thinking of students. This article analyses the courses of high vocational colleges and the characteristics of students firstly. Then we design the teaching activities based upon the principles and strategies of computational thinking. Finally we offer a real teaching case. The teaching evaluations from students indicate that the teaching method based on computational thinking is very effective.},

  abstract={The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.},
