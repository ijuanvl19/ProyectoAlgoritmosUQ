  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.},

  abstract={Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance. Further, the model is used in studying 3 students in order to deduce biomarkers for understanding their psychological conditions.},

  abstract={The manual assessment of creativity by human raters is coupled with unavoidable subjectivity and often costs much time and human resources. To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.},

  abstract={This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill},

  abstract={Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.},

  abstract={A complex or ill-structured problem cannot be solved only replying on computer since they require human's nonlinear thinking and even innovation. In this paper, taking respective advantages of computer and human, we propose a novel computational knowledge environment (CKE) where human is able to cognize tacit and new knowledge for complex or ill-structured problem solving, through fusing potential knowledge discovered from the collected information data supported by computer. Following the CKE framework, we develop a creativity technique called InnoSpider which greatly support human's perception, intuition, reasoning and cognition for quick decision making. A case study have verified the effectiveness of CKE, and have indicated InnoSpider can drive human to make high-quality decisions in a shorter time.},

  abstract={Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.},

  abstract={The recent urgency for counterterrorism and the fight to protect ones' homeland are of grave concern to nations throughout the world. Finding an efficient process that could have screened passengers prior to boarding a flight or even a train may have derailed many devastating events. Scientific research has continuously proved that there is an explicit marker of neuronal activity that correlates with awareness, past experience, and short-term interactions from the well-known P300 peak of an evoked potential. This study examines the effects of memory recognition to certain key stimuli mixed with irrelevant variables in an effort to identify if a trained terrorist, per se, could not only be identified from a group of subjects, but also validate that the willingness to withhold information is out of the control of the individual; it's simple, one has no control in concealing their brain's activity.},

  abstract={In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.},

  abstract={Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.},

With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years.

The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={148-153},
  abstract={The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don‚Äôt use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called ‚ÄúTrashman‚Äù. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer‚Äôs expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game‚Äôs end. This will evaluate player‚Äôs performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.},

  abstract={Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.},

  abstract={Research-based learning (RBL) familiarizes students with the academic research process at an early stage and at the same time offers them the opportunity to actively shape their own learning process. Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education.},

To the founders of computing and computing education whom I met through ACM, including Eckert, Mauchly, Perlis, Newell, Simon, Forsythe, Conte, Wilkes, Hamming, Knuth, and Dijkstra. To my teachers at MIT who turned this electrical engineer into one of the first holders of a computer science degree, especially Fano, Corbato, Dennis, Saltzer, Scherr, and Zadeh. To my many colleagues in computer science and engineering over the years, too numerous to mention by name here, who engaged me in edifying conversations about computing.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.},

  abstract={The United States (U.S.) is going through a preschool through 12th grade education transition to Common Core State Standards (CCSS), initially English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics (Math). Computational and model thinking can lead to a practice of computer coding where many of the necessary shifts in learning the ELA and Math standards can be incorporated. A new initiative by Paradise Valley Unified School District (PVUSD) to teach coding to K-8 students, and the requisite computational/model thinking through CCSS activities and lesson plans is provided. Three Gifted Education teachers (1st/2nd grades, 3rd/4th grades, 5th/6th grades) and the Information Technology Director articulate and showcase some explorations of teaching computer coding. The teachers and their students have been exposed to a variety of computational/model thinking activities and web portals/platforms (e.g., Codecademy, Scratch, App Inventor, Khan Academy, etc.), IOS/Android Apps, and web sites as listed at http://ccc.pvlearners.net. All students have access to tablets, Chromebooks, and TelePresence units to facilitate their creation and collaboration in coding.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision&#x2010;makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, &#x2018;systemic critique&#x2019;, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, &#x2018;systemic pluralism&#x2019;, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, &#x2018;systemic improvement&#x2019;, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to &#x2018;systemic pragmatism&#x2019;. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>},

  abstract={Recently, metaverse have been used in education to improve learners' interest and engagement. In particular, there have been studied various educational models such as theory, practice, and project classes in SW education programs. In this study, we aim to verify whether the SW education program has a significant effect on computational thinking and communication skills by using the communication-centered model (C-UMC), which centers on ‚Äòcommunication‚Äô as one of the characteristics of the metaverse. The SW education program applied in this study targets 23 high school students and is conducted for 16 sessions (2 hours √ó 8 sessions). This study is an ongoing research, and we presented the design process for conducting the study, as well as the current classroom process and preliminary results. For further study, we will perform an effectiveness analysis on whether there was a significant difference in learners' computational thinking and communication skills.},
