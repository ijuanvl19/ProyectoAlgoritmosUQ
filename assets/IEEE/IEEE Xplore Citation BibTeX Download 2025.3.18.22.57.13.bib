  abstract={Group learning offers novel yet intriguing opportunities to improve a community's effectiveness by obtaining insight into the emergence of new design problems and concepts. This article proposes a new computational model and the related algorithmic methods to characterize circuit design communities over time. The bottom-up model explains knowledge evolution using two operators, combination/improvement for knowledge expansion, and blocking for concept elimination. New metrics were proposed to describe the effect of the two operators. Experiments considered three large data sets of circuit designs (switched-capacitor filters, CMOS OpAmp/OTAs, and ΔΣ ADCs). Opportunities to improve the communities were discussed.},

  abstract={Computer Science (CS) seems to be everywhere - in our smartphones, apps, cars, watches and so much more. It is integrated into almost every discipline and has a growing importance in our daily lives, yet even with top salaries, exciting companies, and promising careers, the job market remains underpopulated and under-representative of women. Though its applications are everywhere, CS is an often misunderstood field due to lack of exposure and knowledge. This paper explores the misperception associated with Computer Science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing CS earlier at the K-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses.},

  abstract={The paradigm of education has undergone a significant transition from traditional teacher-directed instruction to student-centered problem-based learning. In various contexts, problem-based learning, computational thinking, and metaphor-based learning approaches have been used to deliver an efficacious learning of the concept. This paper puts forward a model and its usage to build metaphor based case studies directing towards cognitive thinking, self-directed learning and lifelong learning. The model directly influences on the problem solving thought process. The paper further presents a case study on application of this model and its effectiveness validated through the embedded design method. The method appears to be effective in from model analysis and feedback collected. This directly connects to the pattern recognition paradigm of the computational thinking process.},

  volume={18},
  number={4},
  pages={984-995},
  abstract={The conventional mathematical models that are used for traffic distribution and traffic mode choice forecasts consider neither the individual heterogeneity on the micro level nor the changeable traffic scenes. This prompted us to propose a new forecast method composed of a traffic survey, an artificial transportation system (ATS), and computational experiments. We introduced a BDI modeling method in the agent-based ATS. This method considers an individual's psychological characteristics in combination with logical thinking, which was introduced to individual passenger agents, to deduce each passenger's decision-making process when choosing the traffic mode and route. A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split. Furthermore, the outcomes of various vehicle-scheduling plans were predicted and analyzed by using computational experiments to determine the optimal plan and support the establishment of transportation policies in the real world.},

  abstract={Unlike enrollment in undergraduate computer science degree programs, there are no gender or ethnic imbalances in K-12 enrollment. While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.},

  abstract={Introducing middle school students to STEAM projects can foster an interest in computer science and engineering solutions. These projects provide hands-on experiences that may encourage students to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. Engaging students in real-world problems can help them develop critical thinking skills and generate innovative ideas. STEAM projects can also spark students' curiosity and creativity. This paper will explore developing and implementing a STEAM lesson to introduce students to the engineering and design process and computational thinking. Moreover, this project also addresses a major environmental concern currently in New Jersey, specifically the destruction of the environment by the spotted lanternfly. Therefore, students are also applying skills in civil duty and environmental awareness as a part of their design and plan to eradicate this invasive species.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.},

  abstract={We present an exploratory study that aims to diagnose the Engineering in Computational Technologies students' level of awareness with respect to the impact of the accelerated use of technology and the exponential growth that private socio-digital platforms have in everyday life because of the COVID-19 confinement. We research possible deterministic postures in the students' positions that could impede their ethical analysis of the social and environmental effects of the advance of data capitalism, among which racialization, algorithmic sexualization, and discrimination, as well as the erosion of the Commons on the Internet, stand out. The theoretical approach comes from a decolonial ethical framework, and the methodology of this study is qualitative. It consists of, in the first phase of the implementation, two focus groups with engineering students between the ages of 19 and 22 from different semesters and genders. In a second phase, we include eight in-depth interviews with professors from the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities who teach disciplinary and general education subjects in two campuses of a private university in Mexico.},

  abstract={This paper proposed an intelligent path-following control strategy that combines the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and Q-learning (QL) for an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with unknown model parameters. The improved LOS achieves satisfactory path-following results for USVs with uncertain models, where the embedded QL method learns the vehicle model by the self-regulation of uncertain parameters to accomplish the robustness and adaptation for the path-following. Simulation results in tracking a straight line and a circular path are demonstrated respectively. The environmental effect of wave disturbances is also analyzed, which verifies the effectiveness of the improved LOS method based on QL.},

  abstract={The deleterious effects of not bringing projects quickly from the laboratory to the market are described, and corporate efforts to cut development time are examined. Many Japanese companies have already wrestled with this problem and moved on to other issues, like their need for basic research. As a result, many US corporations are looking to the Japanese for guidance. This is leading companies to restructure their organizations to encourage open, frequent, and early communication. Launching research projects with technology transfer in view from the start is another approach modeled after the Japanese. Central to Japanese technology transfer is the fact that as a project moves from laboratory to market, the engineers move with it. This is also being tried by some US firms. A less widespread approach to shortening time to market is called concurrent engineering, in which an item is designed concurrently with the processes that would be used to assemble it, manufacture its parts, test it, and repair it in the field. Standardization is also being used to boost researchers' output.<>},

  abstract={Currently, the power sector is characterized by the dispersion of data across different times, spaces, or complexities, as well as difficulties in the unified collection of sample data, leading to significant challenges in obtaining multi-scale fine-tuning samples. In light of this, this paper focuses on the collection and preprocessing of textual data in the power sector and proposes a method for constructing multi-scale fine-tuning samples in the power sector based on the chain of thought. By introducing multi-scale analysis methods, power system data is divided according to different temporal and spatial scales, thereby creating a sample set with hierarchical structure and diversity. This method can adaptively adjust the selection and enhancement strategies of samples based on the characteristics of data at different scales, thus effectively representing and modeling the complex data of the power system and improving the efficiency and accuracy of text data processing in the power sector.},

  abstract={Design rationale (DR) explains the product design decision-making process and the reason behind the decision. Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction. Partial design process of the POGO mechanical system design is taken as an example to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

This problem is widely applied in many fields such as physics, economics, etc. Systems for automatic solving integral problems are necessary tools in education.

However, they output the result only or are limited to give the complete solution. This paper presents a model for representing knowledge about single variable functions and proposes some algorithms for solving integral problem automatically.

Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper presents a case study that explores the successful integration of project-based learning (PBL) in two courses, Biometry and Computer Vision, at the University of -DFBR-. The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pedagogical practice for technical high school students for developing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities through Internet of Things technologies. The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={With the evolution of communication technologies, various substantial applications help the human community. Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption. Therefore, the model attains superior security and efficiency.},

  abstract={In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.},

  abstract={Open-source research software plays a central role in accelerating advances in science and engineering. Its increasing significance, however, incentivizes malicious actors to attack that software and compromise the systems on which it runs, undermining the free and open exchange of trustworthy research codes. In the world of conventional software development, there has been a shift towards integrating security as early as possible in the development process to guard against malicious activity. Given the potential risks at hand, developers of research software must consider how to do the same across the research software lifecycle. This editorial argues for the need to unite diverse forms of expertise in scientific computing and software security to address these challenges and outlines a roadmap for future work in this space.},

  abstract={In college life, pressure is the main cause of student suicides, highlighting a significant societal and academic challenge that demands urgent attention for early detection systems and support mechanisms. Addressing this issue proactively is crucial. To tackle this, we introduce machine learning models designed to identify suicidal tendencies in students. These models analyze various data points such as depression levels and experiences of discrimination to predict suicide risk levels—high, medium, or low, in the near future. By using predictive analytics, our approach aims to identify those in need so that they can receive the necessary support promptly, thereby reducing the risk of student suicides and promoting a safer, more supportive environment in academic institutions.},

  abstract={The various methods for remote learning has been there in the global education system even from the mid of 90’s. The technology aided online teaching learning process has come to its natural evolution and pace these years. Various technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning etc has made the system very effective and efficient. The technology driven education, be it simple or complex has its own relevance in dealing with certain subjects. By this, subjects can be made interesting,comprehensive and it develops students creativity and imagination. The technology driven education system is not still common because of the mind set of the people, poor connectivity, inadequate technology upgradation in schools. Even though after the advent of the pandemic the use of online tools for education has increased, the suitability of each technology for different age groups is still a matter of concern. Cascading different methods, customizing the technology based on the subject taught is of prime importance. The paper research on various technologies involved in online teaching learning process and try to know the suitability of each technology in different contexts.},
