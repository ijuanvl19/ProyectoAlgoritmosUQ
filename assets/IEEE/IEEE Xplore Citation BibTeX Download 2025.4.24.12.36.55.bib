  abstract={Creativity becomes an ever important feature in software development nowadays as software application in various domains is on an ever rapid growth. It leads to changes on system requirements, hoping to improve systems with attractive creativity features. Consequently, creative computing is aroused as an emerging research field in software engineering. Currently, there are researches working on approaches and processes to develop creative software from scratch. However, evolving existing systems can achieve the same purpose, though it is hard to add creativity features to legacy systems by traditional software evolution approaches. Obviously, based on experiences over decades from software community, development from scratch might cause a waste in terms of resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Model Driven Architecture based reverse engineering method for creative evolution. Abstraction techniques are explored, classified, designed and applied in this proposed approach. Meanwhile, details and roles of abstraction techniques were developed for each step. Also, an e-learning system is chosen as a case study to illustrate, validate and evaluate the proposed method. Overall, our work aims to contribute to software evolution methodology and its application creatively.},

  abstract={Currently, tourism and heritage research areas are connected with computer science methods and techniques for detecting potential knowledge combinations to improve operating efficiency. In the heritage development process, how to design and provide a valuable and novel routine for visitors is quite essential. This research aims at detecting a method for heritage tourism routine design by using a graphical probability model and graphical database theory. Graphical probability is applied to achieved nodes and vertexes' definition of weights. The graphical database is used for connecting nodes with vertexes and establishing models for target heritage area (potential tourism area). Probability calculation is applied to calculate the weights of each connection. Eventually, the graphical probability model can be used to apply the most valuable routines for users to select when visitors arrive in this unfamiliar tourism area. Creative computing methods are used to achieve knowledge combinations and interdisciplinary methods integration, which are the cardinal parts for applying the graphical model in the heritage area.},

  pages={411-420},
  abstract={This study reports on the development and implementation of the Interactive Design Research Toolkit (IDRT), a mobile application that supports the teaching and learning (T&L) of Human-Centered Design (HCD) practices. Guided by the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) Model of Motivational Design and leveraging mobile microlearning (MML) principles, the IDRT integrates multimodal instructions and gamification features to encourage students to employ HCD. Implemented in a design-project-based class, 37 students' perceptions and engagement were evaluated using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. Results indicate positive feedback, high engagement levels, and increased comprehension of HCD. Analysis of design reports reveals a more diverse application of HCD, particularly among higher-performing students, indicating the IDRT's influence on intrinsic motivation. However, challenges were identified among lower-performing students, indicating the need for further research to enhance engagement. Overall, the study underscores the potential of MML as a viable instruction method to influence students' motivation and proficiency positively and to scaffold the T&L of HCD.},

Then a Knowledge and Ability dual-driven Teaching Model for the course of Compilers Principles is proposed, that is to let students understand and master the compilers theory and technique through the course teaching; in addition, it takes compilation teaching as an approach to reveal and analyze the problem solving rules of "problem--formalized description -- computerization", and systematically trains and improves students' ability to use language and language processors to solve problems and even to solve complex engineering problems. We have tried and popularized this teaching model in the multiple rounds of teaching practices, and embodied this teaching idea in the study and development of the course standard for the course of Compilers Principles.},

  abstract={A lack of early exposure to computer science and a shortage of role models are known barriers hindering underrep-resented students' pursuit and success in the field. Consistent research indicates that students lacking early exposure tend to avoid college-level computer science courses and frequently underperform compared to peers with prior experience. In response, we've created a two-week computer science camp tailored for upper elementary and middle school students from rural and low-income backgrounds. The camp adapts computer science concepts to diverse cultures, challenges stereotypes, and showcases the diverse backgrounds of computer scientists. This paper outlines the camp's design, shares experiences from 40 participating students, and highlights engaging lessons that in-corporate technologies such as Sphero Bolt, Sphero Rover, Tello Drones, Lego Spike Prime, and Scratch. We also gather data on students' favorite activities to understand their interests. Our discussion covers effective strategies for participant recruitment, community trust-building, professional development facilitation, camp activity organization, and project promotion. By sharing challenges and lessons learned, we aim to assist fellow researchers and educators in similar initiatives, fostering collaboration and progress in the field of computer science education.},

  abstract={Teknologi Quran International is a startup company that runs on the education of Islam religion especially in Al-Qur’an recitation. Since this company was founded in 2015, there has been no significant profit from applications that can sponsor the operational cost of the company. This then led to the unfocused development of the Learn Quran Tajwid application because most of the employees now have other external projects outside the company. Therefore, the evaluation of the business model is provided to suggest the monetization model so that the company can gain more profit on its side. The challenged-based learning (CBL) methodology is conducted through qualitative data collection with contextual interviews in order to assess the learning theory which has been implemented and finding the perfect in-app purchasing as well as an organic marketing technique that wants to be implemented in the future. The application that is examined by 20 most convenient user samples and stakeholder’s recommended domain or subject expert, is available on both platforms, Android, and iOS. The evaluation results show that the monetization model of Learn Quran Tajwid needs to be improved completely since right now there are so many possibilities from the active users who have an opportunity to be taken advantage of by the company. This research can also give benefits to a startup company that wants to have a combination of more sustainable monetization models.},

  abstract={Affective interaction with virtual humans can enhance the quality of user experience in virtual reality. It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.},

  abstract={The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.},

ABGIS provides a powerful simulation tool and an envyronment that is an excelent metaphor to represent our spatio-temporal world. With ABGIS we could explore the dynamics of spatio-temporal systems, particularly, but not exclusively, complex systems. It is possible to simulate complex systems having as a starting point only simple elements (agents), embedded in some type of environment. These agents can inter-act which each other in only specific and very simple ways. As the result of the interaction among the agents and the environment, the behavior of the complex system at macrocosmic level then emerges. According this line of thinking, there are a lot of social, biological, and ecological processes that can be simulated by agent-based models [1],[2]. In this article we give a general description of the desirable capabilities of ABSGIS, describing some features it should incorporate, and presenting some examples that could explore this kind of tool.},

The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users. It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.},

  abstract={Multicluster Grid has emerged as a major approach for people to pursue substantial computational capability improvement to support large-scale compute-intensive applications. However, it is challenging on how to efficiently manage application execution across the participating clusters, since the participating clusters are geographically distributed, heterogeneous, and self-administrative, and the network connection provided by the Internet is vulnerable in security and unpredictable in performance. The challenges include how to discover resource information, how to handle application workflow, how to allocate appropriate resources, how to make application execution reliable to endure system failures, etc. This paper proposes cluster abstraction to uniform describe and access resources in multicluster Grid. After investigating various cluster resource management systems, a reference description of cluster abstraction is presented to cover cluster computing characteristics, hiding individual cluster details for use. Following this concept, a deployment service is discussed. This deployment service is one of the essential components in ongoing resource management development for multicluster Grids.},

  abstract={In the ever-evolving field of technologies, the emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI), often referred as strong artificial intelligence (AI), stands as a breakthrough in the realm of machine intelligence, promising to witness a new era of capabilities and possibilities. In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.},

Nowadays, since Moore's Law is no longer applicable, conventional thinking may not be adequate in facing the explosive growing amount of data. Hence, in this paper, we adopt the idea of in-memory processing to solve the problem of real-time multimedia big data computing in IoT. We apply closed-loop feedback in the scheduling method design to integrate in-memory storages of all devices within a 3-tier network structure. In addition, we consider the respective conditions of different real-time required levels and content forms. The analysis results show that our scheduling method can achieve better workload allocation with less latency in comparison of existing methods.},

  abstract={A fluent ability to associate tasks, concepts, ideas, knowledge and experiences in a relevant way is often considered an important factor of creativity, especially in problem solving. We are interested in providing computational support for discovering such creative associations. In this paper we design minimally supervised methods that can perform well in the remote associates test (RAT), a well-known psychometric measure of creativity. We show that with a large corpus of text and some relatively simple principles, this can be achieved. We then develop methods for a more general word association model that could be used in lexical creativity support systems, and which also could be a small step towards lexical creativity in computers.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide aerial-terrestrial computing services in close proximity to mobile devices (MDs). However, meeting the demands of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks for MDs poses several challenges, including the demand-supply contradiction between MDs and MEC servers, the demand-supply discrepancy between MDs and MEC servers, the trajectory control requirements on energy efficiency and timeliness, and the different time-scale dynamics of the network. To address these issues, we first present a hierarchical architecture by incorporating terrestrial-aerial computing capabilities and leveraging UAV flexibility. Furthermore, we formulate a joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control problem to maximize the system utility. Since the problem is a non-convex and NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a two-timescale joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control (TJCCT) approach for solving the problem. In the short timescale, we propose a price-incentive model for on-demand computing resource allocation and a matching mechanism-based method for computation offloading. In the long timescale, we propose a convex optimization-based method for UAV trajectory control. Besides, we theoretically prove the stability and polynomial complexity of TJCCT. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TJCCT is able to achieve superior performances in terms of the system utility, average processing rate, average completion delay, average completion ratio, and average cost, while meeting the energy constraints despite the trade-off of the increased energy consumption.},
