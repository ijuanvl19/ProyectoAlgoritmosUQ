  abstract={Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students' learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.},

  abstract={Intelligence in engineering systems is expected to gain much more attention during the next years than presently because making interdependent decisions along contextual chains by an engineer increasingly requires reproduction of earlier decisions by other engineers. While a single decision on an object parameter or parameter group in a product structure may be influenced by several humans, humans are strictly responsible for their decisions. The only way is development of transparent intelligent engineering procedures those are capable for representation of humans. The above features of engineering tasks do not allow application of closed procedures from the conventional knowledge engineering and computational intelligence. The authors are engaged in application of knowledge based methods in intelligent engineering. This paper starts with purposeful characterizing of intelligent engineering features in current industrial product modeling systems. Following this, it discusses possibilities for adding intelligence to current product modeling processes. An earlier proposed method by the authors in modeling of human intent driven engineering objectives and contextual connections as entities to assist decisions is applied. Finally, the authors propose a possible way to capture human thinking process element in order to establish intelligent content in product models. The starting point of the proposed modeling is current modeling functionality of industrial product lifecycle management systems widely applied in aircraft, car, house appliance and other industries.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In this paper we describe the results of a rigorous empirical study evaluating the coping responses of a computational model of emotion. We discuss three key kinds of coping, Wishful Thinking, Resignation and Distancing that impact an agent's beliefs, intentions and desires, and compare these coping responses to related work in the attitude change literature. We discuss the EMA computational model of emotion and identify several hypotheses it makes concerning these coping processes. We assess these hypotheses against the behavior of human subjects playing a competitive board game, using monetary gains and losses to induce emotion and coping. Subject's appraisals, emotional state and coping responses were indexed at key points throughout a game, revealing a pattern of subject's al-tering their beliefs, desires and intentions as the game unfolds. The results clearly support several of the hypotheses on coping responses but also identify (a) extensions to how EMA models Wishful Thinking as well as (b) individual differences in subject's coping responses.},

  abstract={This experience report paper reports on case studies of final exams that used creative problem solving to assess students’ ability to apply the material, and divergent thinking to ensure that each student’s exam was unique. We report on two senior-level software engineering courses, taught a total of six times across three semesters. The paper gives enough information for readers to adapt this method in their own courses. Our exams include built-in divergence properties, which are elements or decisions that lead students to more than one good answer. Based on our experience, divergent thinking, creative problem solving exams not only provide excellent assessments of student knowledge, but ensure the integrity of the exam process, even when students work without supervision. We developed this strategy during the pandemic when all courses were online, but find them to be better than our traditional exams and are now using this strategy for in-person courses.},

  title={Undergraduate Education in Computational Pathology Through Global Health Inspired Projects}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Recent technological advancements are revolutionizing the field of pathology as the practice adopts digital workflows and computational tools to augment the analysis of tissue and enhance its role in patient care. These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level. In addition, standard didactic courses struggle to keep with the rapid pace of advancements driving the field, build the essential multidisciplinary teamwork skills, train the technical skillsets required for success, or emphasize innovation. Structured experiential learning (EL) has a long track record of success in addressing these issues and presents as a natural modality for early CPATH education. We have designed and piloted a project based EL course targeted towards undergraduates to address these limitations in CPATH education. At the core of the course experience, students work together to conceptualize, design, and implement innovative solutions to leverage CPATH towards addressing global health inequity. Here we present our design of the course, review insights from our first two years of piloting this course and share plans for course improvement drawn from these insights.Clinical relevance— CPATH is making a significant impact on the practice of pathology and is poised to play a major role in addressing global health inequities. This course is designed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to innovate in this rapidly growing and developing field as members of multidisciplinary teams through structured project based EL. While open to students at the undergraduate and master’s level from all backgrounds, it is directed at undergraduate biomedical engineering, computer science, and pre medicine students who are interested in future careers in this field.},

  abstract={The prerequisite knowledge regarding Computer Science (CS) varies strongly among freshmen at university and it seems advisable to compensate for these differences before the first lecture starts. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) might represent a possible solution. We therefore designed and developed a MOOC (called “LOOP: Learning Object-Oriented Programming”) which provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and object-oriented concepts before the programming part. In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises. Yet, the overall feedback was encouragingly positive. In this paper, we describe the design and the development of the course, as well as our initial results.},

  abstract={To address the problem of underexposure, underrepresentation, and underproduction of diverse professionals in the field of computing, we target middle school education using an idea that combines computational thinking with dance and movement choreography. This lightning talk delves into a virtual reality education and entertainment application named Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.},

  abstract={The increased push for access to computer science (CS) at the K-12 level has been argued as a way to broaden participation in computing. At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers. We highlight this approach using classroom video observation from four teachers and discuss future work in this area.},

  abstract={Comprehensive theories of conflict in the cyber world have not yet been developed, but the utilization of traditional military strategy and operational concepts in lieu of existing strategies in this realm can mislead, resulting in spurious assessments and unfavorable outcomes. Four tenets of the cyber world present profound challenges for the application of traditional military strategies in cyber conflicts. The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown. As a result, the use of traditional military thinking and path-dependent behavior in cyber is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions regarding strategic achievements and abilities in the pre-conflict stage, and increase the risk of strategic failure during conflict and provide an opportunity for an adversary's strategic surprise.},

In this case, the suggested version of ontological support helps to create and use the project ontology in parallel with the reasoning in their coordinated applying with other mechanisms of design thinking. Such intertwined process leads to the controlled use of the chosen lexicon, timely discovering the semantic errors and achieving the necessary understanding of its managerial potential.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on explicit considering of motives and goals at the stage of design thinking when designers try to understand the system to be designed as a wholeness. For this, it is advisable to apply the architecture approach, developing an initial complex of the essential views of the corresponding architectural description. The complex must not only provide an initial understanding of the future system but also demonstrates the conditions under which the intended goals will be attained. We propose a version of creating the complex by solving the systems of conceptual equations, any of which corresponds to the cause-and-effect discourse of an abductive kind. The version is realized in the instrumental environment that supports automated design thinking.},

  abstract={Almost all current matchmaking systems for team competition games based on player skill ratings contain algorithms designed to create teams consisting of players at similar skill levels. However, these systems overlook the important factor of playing style. In this paper, we analyze how playing style affects enjoyment in team competition games, using a mix of Sternberg's thinking style theory and individual histories in the form of statistics from previous matches to categorize League of Legend (LoL) players. Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength. We also used a neural network model to test the usefulness of playing style information in predicting match quality. It is our hope that these results will support the establishment of more efficient matchmaking systems.},

TNPS integrates Education, Neuroscience and Technological dimensions, which facilitate the development of cognitive profile of student thinking in order to customize his/her learning activities. In our experiments, an increment in the weights of thinking style used by the students on a Structured Programming course was observed.},

  abstract={With the proposal of quality-oriented education, Scratch programming teaching in elementary schools is of great importance to the growth and development of students. The visual interface, building block programming, and easy-to-use features of Scratch are suitable for teaching elementary school students, which can also better cultivate students’ analytical problem-solving skills and enhance their logical thinking. However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom.},

  abstract={Meta-synthesis approach (MSA) proposed by Prof. Qian is an oriental system methodology for complex problem solving. The essential idea of MSA can be simplified as "confident hypothesizing, rigorous validating", i.e. quantitative knowledge arises from qualitative understanding. Accordingly, creative thinking as a useful and practical technique for complex problem solving, is the unity of divergent thinking and convergent thinking which appear alternatively in the whole creative process of human thinking. In this paper, a computational scheme based on MSA is applied to solve the complex problems. Firstly, group argumentation environment (GAE) as a computerized tool is used to facilitate expert divergent thinking process (meeting) on the concerned topics and form scenario or hypotheses based on qualitative MSA. Then, a quantitative evaluation model had been building to analyze the centralization of the different scenarios, which can used to measure the efficient of different argumentation scenario.},

  abstract={Human-level intelligence implies creativity, not only on the grand scale, but primarily in the everyday activity, such as understanding intentions, behavior, and invention of new words. Psychological models of creativity have some support in experimental cognitive psychology, but computational models of creative processes are quite rare. This paper presents a model of creative processes behind invention of novel words related to description of products and services.},
