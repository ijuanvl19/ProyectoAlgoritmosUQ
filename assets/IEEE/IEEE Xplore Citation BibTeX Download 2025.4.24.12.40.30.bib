  abstract={Data is the most significant factor in production, next to labor, land, and capital. It concerns the management and sharing of data and experience for an structural network's development. Data Management (DM) has become more important in the competitive market world for sustainable structural development. Data Management (DM) is the process for integrating structural data for the Data management long-term gain. This is focused on strategic planning requiring the development and support of multiple data-centric management processes. Hence, in this paper, Adaptive Heterogeneous Structural Equation Modeling (AHSEM) - A physics vertical has been proposed to develop effective strategic Data management planning for an structural network based on the data management process. This paper indicates that the lack of a well-defined development strategy to guide implementation is a significant cause of several DM initiatives' failure. This paper explores the strategic planning requirements of the DM implementation process and develops a structure that companies may use directly to manage implementation. The numerical results show a high-performance ratio when compared to other existing methods.},

Additionally, it provides quicker innovation while simultaneously providing flexible resources.Deep learning (DL), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is widely seen as a key technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0). The artificial neural network (ANN)-based technique known as deep learning (DL) has gained popularity in the computing world due to its capacity for learning from data. frequently used in a variety of application fields, including cybersecurity, healthcare, visual recognition, and many more. However, because of the dynamic nature and differences in real-world environments, creating an acceptable DL model is a difficult process. issues and information Additionally, because of a lack of fundamental knowledge, DL techniques become black-box devices that hinder standard level progress.A cloud computing system in an organization offers high data security at a cheap maintenance cost. Business cooperation has increased significantly as a result of cloud technology. Use of AI has enhanced each of those procedures. The use of artificial intelligence in certain industries has a considerable impact on how successful cloud services techniques are, resulting in a consequence, the two innovations' cumulative effect boosts the prosperity of such businesses.

  abstract={Engineering knowledge is complex. Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once. Normally, individual models and behaviours are taught in several courses, by different teaching staff and in separate years of study. This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.},

  abstract={The country's demand for talents with higher English literacy is more and more urgent in the era of internationalization. The rise and development of MOOC (Massive Open On Line Course) is explosive in China, and it has been widely used in various courses of universities, improving the teaching quality and education level effectively. ESP (English for Specific purposes), as a core course to improve students' professional English literacy, plays an irreplaceable role. Traditional ESP teaching has some shortcomings, such as single teaching mode, boring teaching process, obsolete teaching resources, etc. The teaching reform is imperative in order to meet the needs of the times. The emergence of MOOC brings opportunities for ESP teaching.

  abstract={In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.},

  abstract={This research investigates the automatic translation of contracts to computer understandable rules trough Natural Language Processing. The most challenging aspect, which is studied throughout this paper, is to understand the meaning of the contract and express it into a structured format. This problem can be reduced to the Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction tasks, the latter handles the extraction of terms and conditions. These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning. This method is data-hungry, so the research also introduces data sets for these two tasks. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by introducing Law-Bert, a model based on BERT which is pre-trained on unlabelled contracts. The results obtained on Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction show that pre-training on contracts has a positive effect on performance for the downstream tasks.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of computing gate-circuit approximations of quantum algorithms, i.e., unitary operators, from the perspective of computable (effective) analysis. The scientific community thinks the Solovay-Kitaev theorem a mile-stone in quantum compiling - the task of computing gate-circuit approximations - because it proves the existence of efficient quantum compilers in an analytic sense. However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.},

  abstract={People are all currently living in the world where data has changed how company think, act and plan. Data, if used correctly, might be able to become a company's sharpest weapon in fighting the competition with other companies. Inventory cost is one of the most burdening costs in the food and beverage industry with the items like degradable raw materials or fresh ingredients. If not managed correctly might become a waste causing loss to the company. Degraded ingredients also might lower the overall food quality which might result in unsatisfied customers. Managing inventory, however, is not as easy as it seems, especially with the traditional method. This paper focuses on development of accurate predictive model using computational intelligence for optimal inventory management with a case study of restaurant ingredient management. Several machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random tree, random forest, and model trees were utilized to build accurate predictive models from time series data of the restaurant inventory. With good prediction system using computational intelligence, the inventory cost and wasted ingredients can be significantly reduced, which this eventually maximizes the profit.},

  abstract={Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.},

  abstract={This article explores strategies for cultivating a paradigm shift in the engineering design of intelligent machines, moving from conventional anthropocentric priorities toward a more ecocentric orientation aligned with ecological ethics. Through a comprehensive literature review, historical patterns of anthropomorphism in intelligent systems are traced, revealing how human-centered considerations have persistently dominated machine design across eras. To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity. By reforming engineering education and culture from the ground up, the creation of intelligent machines can be realigned to enrich our shared environment rather than simply maximize human primacy. This paper offers a constructive roadmap to transform the promise of increasingly autonomous technologies in the $21^{\text {st }}$ century and beyond.},

These devices are producing massive amount of raw data for different progressive purposes that need to be processed and stored somewhere. Local data storage and complete processing of massive data will not be possible by resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) enabling devices anymore in the future. Therefore, there is a need of data storage and processing capabilities to meet the desired goals of applications. Cloud computing and edge computing are the possible solution to circumvent limited data storage and computation issues of IoT devices. This paper presents a comparative study of popular architectures in which IoT devices are integrated with cloud. For this purpose, various IoT and Cloud of Things (CoT) architectures have been studied. Strengths and weaknesses of the studied IoT and CoT architectures are comprehensively analyzed on the basis of five comparison parameters namely; resource based segregation of IoT enabling devices, range based segregation of the communication network, segregation of security solutions, cloud connectivity, and edge computing services.},

Our work is motivated by the fact that certain domains are very difficult to produce models for, which makes MBT impracticable. We describe a computer-based training agent that has been developed as a result of using dialogue analysis and DM techniques. MBT is investigated as a technique that could be compatible with DM to support instruction through use of dynamic model-based explanations. Together these two techniques enable a computer-based training system to be designed that is able to support technical skills, such as controlling a power plant, and creative skills, such as design.},

This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence—in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs—from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.},

  abstract={High complexity, meaning a model in which components interact in multiple ways and follow certain local rules, is a huge challenge for brain research. This paper presents a semantic vector-driven closed-loop model, namely THINKING-LOOP, for brain computing to improve the understanding and development of complex cognition. The proposed model is a three-layer fusion of data, information and knowledge with human intelligence, which exploits ontological knowledge modeling, rule-based reasoning and a human-computer interaction mechanism. The interaction and collaboration within the model depend on a pair of complementary schemes in a loop: the top-down scheme from the knowledge layer to the data layer that is used to search for stable cognitive patterns; and the bottom-up scheme from the data layer to the knowledge layer that is used to deeply analyze cognitive functions. As a key factor, human beings participate in the whole learning process of the model, which in turn assists human beings to make decisions. To verify the applicability of the present model in cognitive research, a series of fMRI experiments and analytic methods (e.g. statistical tests and network topology analysis) were conducted. The results show that the proposed model is able to take into account the characteristics of different types of brain patterns and cognitive functions, thereby achieving reasonable decision-making level.},

  abstract={The objective of this study is to develop and empirically evaluate an educational model that enhances algorithmic thinking - a key element of computational literacy - through the application with the concept of so called semantic waves for advancing K-12 students' digital proficiency. The concept of a semantic wave refers to the process of moving between abstract, theoretical knowledge and concrete, practical examples to create deeper understanding and learning. Considering this, our proposed model in the field of algorithmic thinking is intended to support pre-service computer science teachers and educators in designing instructional processes that are easy to implement and facilitate swift planning and reflection for K-12 computer science education. Initial results indicate promising outcomes but also suggested areas for enhancement. This research furthermore delves into refining the model through the incorporation of notional machines and the computational action approach for improving the training of future computer science teachers and students for the challenges of digital transformation.},

  abstract={Constrained by the finite depth of field (DOF) in optical cameras, imaging devices face difficulties in achieving complete sharpness across all objects or areas within the same scene. Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described.},
