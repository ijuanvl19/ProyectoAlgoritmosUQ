  title={Hyponymy Graph Model for Word Semantic Similarity Measurement},

  pages={96-101},
  abstract={Measuring word semantic similarity is a generic problem with a broad range of applications such as ontology mapping, computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Previous approaches to computing word semantic similarity did not consider concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number. This paper introduced Hyponymy graph, and based on which proposed a novel word semantic similarity model. For two words to be compared, we first retrieve their related concepts; then produce lowest common ancestor matrix and distance matrix between concepts; finally calculate distance-based similarity and information-based similarity, which are integrated to get final semantic similarity. The main contribution of our method is that both concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number are taken into account. This similarity measurement more closely fits with human rating and effectively simulates human thinking process. Our experimental results on benchmark dataset M&C and R&G with WordNet2.1 as platform demonstrate roughly 0.9%-1.2% improvements over existing best approaches.},

  abstract={A STEAM-based approach to education is presented that encompasses science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), with the addition of “the Arts” as a means of reversing continuing declines in science, math, and reading scores in U.S. secondary schools and to better prepare future STEAM scholars and professionals. This is despite the significant emphasis U.S. schools have placed on STEM curricula for nearly the past 20 years. The 2014 New York State Department of Labor report states, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has indicated that the United States needs at least one million more STEM workers than is currently available. The report also cites that 75 percent of students who graduate with a STEM-related degree do not take STEM jobs; however, the need for STEM careers is 2.5 times higher than other fields within New York State. A case study of Project Fibonacci® is presented whose approach is one of immersive learning that emphasizes math within a STEAM context, holding focused STEAM educational forums, and establishing centers of excellence in STEAM education. This may offer additional benefits beyond traditional STEM-only approaches. There is an upward trend towards STEAM-focused curricula driven by the decline in academic scores, which provides more challenges for our youth to compete in the global workforce; and recognizing that STEAM builds upon math as the interconnection between the science and art disciplines, thus expanding career opportunities and experience that ensure a well-rounded citizenry. We are rediscovering the need for balancing the cognitive and logical sides of the brain with the creative force to engender an agile, growth-driven nationwide community.},

  title={Black Political Participation in the Volunteer State},

  pages={643-648},
  abstract={There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.},

  abstract={Initial programming education is a topic that con-tinues to spark much debate, as it is an academic field with a notably high rate of student dropouts and failures. The challenge of offering this subject through distance education adds to the complexity, given the need for students to adapt to this mode of teaching and learning, which significantly differs from traditional classroom settings. Multiple studies suggest that students must appropriately develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills for effective learning. Yet, there is a pressing need for further investigation into the impact of non-cognitive skills on student performance, with a particular focus on motivation, which plays an important role in student success. In this sense, considering the specificities of learning programming, the context of distance education, this research aims to understand the factors that can stimulate students' motivation for initial learning of programming, developing a virtual learning environment that promotes student motivation to learn to program and evaluate the environment to identify whether its features have the potential to stimulate student motivation.},

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) network will shift its focus to supporting everything including various machine-type devices (MTDs) in an every-one-centric manner. To ubiquitously cover the MTDs working in rural and disastrous areas, satellite communications become indispensable, while mobile edge computing (MEC) also plays an increasingly crucial role. Their sophisticated integration enables wide-area edge intelligence which promises to facilitate globally-distributed customized services. In this article, we present typical use cases of integrated satellite-MEC networks and discuss the main challenges therein. Inspired by the protein structure and the systematic engineering methodology, we propose three minimal integrating structures, based on which a complex integrated satellite-MEC network can be treated as their extension and combination. We discuss the unique characteristics and key problems of each minimal structure. Accordingly, we establish an on-demand network orchestration framework to enrich the hierarchy of network management, which further leads to a process-oriented network optimization method. On that basis, a case study is utilized to showcase the benefits of on-demand network orchestration and process-oriented network optimization. Finally, we outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure, and greener integrated network.},

  pages={545-550},
  abstract={Reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) system has emerged as a promising avenue to achieve high communication performance while adapting to versatile commercial wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to optimally program a reconfigurable RF system in order to achieve maximum performance and/or minimum power. Our key idea is to adopt an equation-based optimization method that relies on general-purpose, non-convex polynomial performance models to determine the optimal configurations of all tunable circuit blocks. Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification. A reconfigurable RF front-end example designed for WLAN 802.11g demonstrates that the proposed method successfully finds the globally optimal configuration, while other traditional techniques often converge to local optima.},

  year={2015},

  pages={1824-1831},
  abstract={An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-and-see") and active ("here-and-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Scheduling is a crucial task in various real-life situations, including educational institutions where creating a feasible timetable is a complex challenge due to numerous constraints. The educational timetable scheduling problem is NP-hard, making it a difficult problem to solve optimally within reasonable time frames. Traditional methods like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been applied to this problem with varying degrees of success. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatic timetable generation using neural networks trained by genetic algorithms. Our method leverages the strengths of neural networks in pattern recognition and GAs in optimization to effectively handle the constraints and complexities of timetable scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in scheduling accuracy and computational efficiency. We compare the performance of our proposed method with traditional GAs and demonstrate that the neural network approach trained by GAs achieves superior results in terms of speed and solution quality. This research paves the way for more efficient and intelligent scheduling systems in educational environments.},

  abstract={Puzzles have long history and have been developed by many people. Nowadays computers are contributing very much to the evolution of puzzles. First computers were used to make arithmetical puzzles, like 'arithmetical restoration' or 'crypt-arithmetic,' then to make mechanical puzzles, like 'burr puzzles' or 'polyomino puzzles' and to make pencil and paper puzzles like 'sudoku.' So now puzzle creators of all genres use computers and they can make more beautiful puzzles with computers than before. Computers changed not only puzzle creators, but also puzzle solvers. Now many puzzle solvers are also computer programmers, and they enjoy puzzles by finding the way of solving puzzles by computers. Of course humans and computers are different in the way of thinking, so computer-solving isn't usually the intention of puzzle creators. But some puzzles are especially for computer programmers and we can say such are new tendency in the puzzle world.},

He discusses the difficulties associated with the design of a shell for a QMB and proposes the use of a semishell, which assists the knowledge engineers in writing the logic, uncertainty and inference modules of the QMB expert system program. The design and coding of the modules that deal with the numerical data is left to the knowledge engineer. The operation of a QMB having 43 rules is described.

  abstract={The difficulty of grid-enabled application development is one of the obstacles to employ grid as infrastructure of scientific computing. Although there are many projects, especially grid workflow projects, trying to make grid-enabled application development easier and quicker, the process-based application description model adopted by most of the grid-enabled applications still bothers scientists who are usually beginner in programming. In this paper, a data dependency based application description model is proposed, which describes a grid-enabled application via dependency among data items in the application, and much close to the thinking pattern of scientists. Based on this model, a scientific computing oriented grid application description language (SCO-GADL) is proposed, and an engine for supporting its execution is designed and implemented. The extensible plug-in architecture adopted by SCO-GADL and its engine makes them support different grid and non-grid platforms easily. At last, a test shows that grid-enabled scientific applications can be developed easily in SCO-GADL, and executes correctly on the application engine.},

  abstract={Wise healthcare is a typical application of wireless sensor network (WSN), which uses sensors to monitor the physiological state of nursing targets and locate their position in case of an emergency situation. The location of targets need to be determined and reported to the control center, and this leads to the localization problem. While localization in healthcare field demands high accuracy and regional adaptability, the information processing mechanism of human thinking has been introduced, which includes knowledge accumulation, knowledge fusion and knowledge expansion. Furthermore, a fuzzy decision based localization approach is proposed. Received signal strength (RSS) at references points are obtained and processed as position relationship indicators, using fuzzy set theory in the knowledge accumulation stage; after that, optimize degree of membership corresponding to each anchor nodes in different environments during knowledge fusion; the matching degree of reference points is further calculated and sorted in decision-making, and the coordinates of several points with the highest matching degree are utilized to estimate the location of unknown nodes while knowledge expansion. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm get better accuracy performance compared to several traditional algorithms under different typical occasions.},

In addition, as the insert operation of each point is independent, the algorithm has high parallelism. And because the insert operations will not cause the imbalance of the tree structure, the M2M data structure is dynamic. Moreover, it can be shared by all the algorithms based on M2M model which greatly improves the efficiency when a variety of algorithms work simultaneity, such as in image processing and pattern recognition. In all, the M2M model points out a general pattern for designing high parallel algorithms, an efficient strategy for solving multi-operational problems and a new approach for computer to stimulate the thinking pattern of human beings.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.},

  abstract={The contemporary idea for interaction has embraced new understandings of the content of experience and the structure of space. New electronic technologies and advanced digital media have separated realities from the realm of the body and transformed experiences into ubiquitous events. The architectural discourse, once largely a discourse of form and style, has overcome these limitations and encountered, in territories of information, the product of a new way of thinking. Marcos Novak emerges in this context of multimedia as an innovative creator whose "liquid architectures" represent a break with the traditional discourse of physicality. His creations},

  abstract={It is well known that many students struggle and eventually are unsuccessful in their attempt to complete their first computer science course. At Arizona State University, the first course taken by computer science majors and a few other majors is CSE 110. CSE110 teaches first year college students basic programming principles using the Java programming language. In order to do well in this course, students need to not only have a background in basic logical thinking, but also need to know basics about using computers along with Internet and file transfer protocol. To address this problem, a CSE110 workshop has been designed for incoming freshmen that have little or no background in computers. This paper defines the content and instruction of this workshop as well as an assessment of its effectiveness. To help ensure that future freshmen are better prepared, software development curriculum materials are being developed for use at the high school level. Two summer teacher workshops have already been held and a third is planned.},

  abstract={The abnormal pause or rate reduction in breathing is known as the sleep-apnea hypopnea syndrome and affects the quality of sleep of an individual. A novel method for the detection of sleep apnea events (pause in breathing) from peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals obtained from wearable devices is discussed in this paper. The paper details an apnea detection algorithm of a very high resolution on a per-second basis for which a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network- which we termed SomnNET- is developed. This network exhibits an accuracy of 97.08% and outperforms several lower resolution state-of-the-art apnea detection methods. The feasibility of model pruning and binarization to reduce the computational complexity is explored. The pruned network with 80% sparsity exhibited an accuracy of 89.75%, and the binarized network exhibited an accuracy of 68.22%. The performance of the proposed networks is compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract={Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.},
