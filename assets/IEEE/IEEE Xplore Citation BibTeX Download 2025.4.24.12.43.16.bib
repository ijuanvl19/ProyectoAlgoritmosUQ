  abstract={Motor and gearbox are considered the main components in various machines related to its supplying power and transmitting motion role. Operating machines acquire vibration signal that are continuously monitoring by sensors placing close to vibration source. This for processing and identify the machine’ components status. Breakdown of the rotating machine causes significant losses and costs, so the analysis of its vibration signals proved literately avoiding these drawbacks with effective faults diagnosis. This paper proposing two models for gearbox and motor faults identification as an attempt towards finding the optimal performance: The first developed model is a fuzzy logic (FL) based model and the other is genetic algorithm (GA) based model. The intended output of both models reduce time and cost of maintenance. It also indirectly increases the machine component’s life. Additionally, the computational analysis proved that, concerning execution time and accuracy; and with the powerful straight forward representation for uncertainties offered by the Fuzzy Logic; it is indeed reliable, however it presented lower classification accuracy (96% for gear box faults and 93% for motor faults) and lower generalization schema. Yet, the proposed strategy which integrates GA and SVM recorded high performances in optimization and higher classification capabilities (97% for both gear box and motors faults). These factors illustrate the effectiveness and optimal performance of the genetic based model.},

  pages={31798-31807},
  abstract={Media bias has been extensively studied by both social and computational sciences. However, current work still has a large reliance on human input and subjective assessment to label biases. This is especially true for cable news, which has a continued presence in American media but a lack of text-based bias identification in research. To address these issues, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to characterize the bias of cable news programs without any human input. This method relies on the analysis of what topics are mentioned through Named Entity Recognition and how those topics are discussed through Stance Analysis in order to cluster programs with similar biases together. Applying our method to 2020 cable news transcripts, we find that cable news programs tend to cluster together consistently over time and roughly correspond to the cable news network of the program. This method reveals the potential for future tools to more objectively assess media bias and characterize unfamiliar media environments, and the empirical results insight into the nature of bias in American cable news programs.},

  abstract={The study of adapting and evolving autonomous agents should be based on a complex systems-theoretic framework which requires both self-organizing and symbolic dimensions. An inclusive framework based on the notions of semiotics and situated action is advanced to build models capable of representing, as well as evolving in their environments. Such undertaking is pursued by discussing the ways in which symbol and self-organization are irreducibly intertwined in evolutionary systems. This way, we re-think the notion of autonomy of evolving systems, and show that evolutionary systems are characterized by a particular type of syntactic autonomy. Developments in emergent computation in cellular automata are discussed as examples of the emergence of syntactic autonomy in computational environments. New results emphasizing this syntactic autonomy in cellular automata are presented.},

  title={How Various Educational Features Influence Programming Performance in Primary School Education}, 
  year={2024},

  abstract={In the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.},

  pages={741-746},
  abstract={In this work, and inspired by the theory of bounded rationality and recursive reasoning, we propose two frameworks for modeling players’ behaviors and for choosing their policies in multi-agent dynamic stochastic game settings. In particular, we define multiple levels of rationality for each player, where at each level a player may reason about everyone else in two different ways; first, they may assume that the rest of the players have a cognitive level that is immediately lower than theirs, which is known as level-k thinking; second, they may assume that the rest of the players’ cognitive level follows a Poisson distribution, which is known as cognitive hierarchy. We construct algorithms for estimating the players’ policies at each level of rationality, both in a level-recursive as well as in a level-paralleled manner, and we study these algorithms’ convergence properties. Simulations on a grid world are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed models.},

  abstract={Computer programming is often presented to students as an abstract discipline that looks aseptic and ultimately boring to many learners; learners find their first computing course uninspiring and programming hard and socially isolating. This causes a decline in the interest in computing among learners. Although there have been many attempts to make computing appealing, more interesting, easier and enjoyable, many educators are still using the classic methods in teaching and learning computer programming. The aim of this work is to call the attention of computing educators to an approach that uses 3D virtual environments to teaching programming. We introduce this approach through a tool that offers innovative methods for teaching wide spectrum of computing topics; Alice. Alice is an innovative programming environment that can be used to create stories by animating characters in a 3D world. Alice is written in Java and has an object-oriented flavor. The paper presents a review of research on using Alice in motivating teaching programming and problem solving, algorithmic thinking, software modeling, and game design and implementation. New trends of using Alice in teaching computing are also suggested.},

Current suicidal ideation detection (SID) methods include clinical methods based on the interaction between social workers or experts and the targeted individuals and machine learning techniques with feature engineering or deep learning for automatic detection based on online social contents. This article is the first survey that comprehensively introduces and discusses the methods from these categories. Domain-specific applications of SID are reviewed according to their data sources, i.e., questionnaires, electronic health records, suicide notes, and online user content. Several specific tasks and data sets are introduced and summarized to facilitate further research. Finally, we summarize the limitations of current work and provide an outlook of further research directions.},

  pages={423-433},
  abstract={Publication productivity affects nearly every aspect of researchers’ scientific career, whereas it is difficult to be predicted due to diversity in researchers’ productivity patterns. This study proposed a model for the publication dynamics of researchers. The model is based on Lotka’s law as well as the relationship between the annual number of publications and time given a historical number of publications. The law and the statistical significance of the relationship are validated by applying them to the high-quality dblp data set. The model allows to predict the number of publications for research groups, and its effectiveness is tested on the data set by fine fittings on the distribution of the number of publications for researchers, the evolutionary trend of their publication productivity, and the probability of producing publications. Due to its nature of regression, the model has the potential to be extended to assess the confidence level of the prediction results and thus would be useful for other empirical research.},

  abstract={Although followership has been widely studied in sociology and management, the problem of finding followers has not drawn attention in the field of artificial intelligence. We refer to the problem of finding followers of a given object as followers search. In sociology, followers are close to their leaders, and leaders are superior to their followers. In this article, aimed at finding followers of a given object, we formulate followers on the basis of both superiority and closeness. The former means that the given object should be superior to followers, and the latter means that followers should be close to the given object. We present a followers search algorithm to find the followers of the given object. Furthermore, we apply the ideas of followers to the market basket and recommender system datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the rationality of the discovered followers on the market basket dataset and the improved performance of the TrustPMF algorithm by adopting followership on recommender system datasets, which indicate a promising future for followers search.},

  abstract={We thank Dahlen & Nolet for the comments (DN05) on our paper (HH05). There are many points of agreement, as we think is clear from HH05, but we respectfully continue to differ in opinion on some fundamental aspects of the finite frequency sensitivity kernels known as ‘banana doughnut’ kernels—hereinafter BDKs, as per the original nomenclature of Dahlen et al.—and their benefit to global tomography. In contrast to DN05’s summary statement, HH05's main concern about BDKs is not the effect of uncertainty in the earthquake source signature or origin time. HH05 argue that (i) the evaluation of sensitivity kernels in simple media has limitations for the interpretation of broad-band signals by means of (linearized) finite frequency tomography; (ii) finite frequency kernels are (indeed) oscillatory, but in general heterogeneity their structure will be complex and different from BD features; (iii) the resolved length scales of model variations are induced by the spectral scales present in the data, which makes the notion of ‘hole’ irrelevant; and (iv) with the need for ‘damping’(regularization) and without a basis that matches properly the multi-scale aspects of finite frequency sensitivity, ray theory or finite frequency theory inversions are likely to yield results that are practically the same.},

  abstract={Proxy re-encryption (PRE) can guarantee the security of data sharing in the cloud making it important in ciphertext sharing in the cloud computing environment. Plenty of the current PRE algorithms based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem are constructed under the random oracle model or have problems such as long public parameter size, large ciphertext expansion rate, etc. We propose an identity-based PRE (IB-PRE) scheme using the LWE problem with short public parameters which can solve the mentioned challenges. Our scheme uses the blocking operation to decrease the public parameter size and a more useful trapdoor generation algorithm to reduce the trapdoor size. These two technologies improve the computational efficiency of the public key. We think that when we divide the identity id into 16 blocks, without much increase in computational overhead, the public key size can be reduced by 88.34%, and the scheme’s security level can remain unchanged. Our scheme achieves adaptive IND-ID-CPA security. It is unidirectional, collusion-resistant, and constructed under the standard model.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease progress over several years, it slowly ruins memories and thinking ability, and eventually the capacity to carry out daily tasks, leading to full-time care. The brain shrinks and loses brain cells as a result of Alzheimer's disease. While the condition can strike at any age, most patients with Alzheimer's disease are over 65.. Alzheimer patients mostly have Symptoms like memory loss, disorientation and problems with thinking ability but vary from person to person. Although genetics, environment, and lifestyle are the most likely causes of this illness, other experts think there may be multiple causes. The term “dementia” refers to brain illnesses that impair thinking, memory, and behaviour. The most typical cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease typically struggle to speak clearly, identify relatives and friends, and recognise items. They can also become angry, restless, and frustrated. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, physical issues like weakness, loss of balance, and impaired bladder and bowel control appear. In this study paper, we will introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, to recognise Alzheimer's disease. On the input image, image segmentation is carried out. CNN is a group of artificial neural networks that provides a more scalable approach to image classification and identification of patterns in images. Convolution is a mathematical procedure that CNN employs in place of matrix multiplication at one layer. CNN are different from other neural networks by their exceptional performance with audio, image or speech signal inputs. CNN algorithm take an input image, assign priority to different aspects for an image to find difference between images. CNN Captures Spatial and Temporal dependencies of an image using application of relevant filters.},

  abstract={Whenever anyone focuses attention to solve a problem through Operations Research and Management Science methodology, it is required to address the problem from the perspective of scientific thinking as well as from the thinking of Art side. Sense of both science and arts is required to shape a totality. However, it is noted that much has been written about the science of decision making: mathematical models, solution algorithms, procedures following structural analysis etc. But unfortunately it is observed that relatively very little has been written in the perspective of Arts to solve the problems. There is no denying the fact that the creativity is the most important attribute of good management and it also helps to drill longitudinally and laterally sense of research and innovative ideas and conceptions and things will assume totality as and when both the sense of Arts and Science is meaningfully applied. Thus creativity is very much linked with problem solving but it is observed that it has, ironically, been largely ignored as a very important and forceful weapon of OR/MS problem solving process. In this paper a sincere attempt has been taken to synthesize explicitly OR/MS literature which has got closed link with creative thinking for solving problems and we shall try to provide here a framework for integrating structured creative thinking technologies with regard to OR/MS methodology and we will also discuss in this perspective of its implication for education, research and practice.},

For large-scale events such as televised debates and speeches, the amount of content on social media can easily become overwhelming, yet still contain information that may aid and augment reporting via individual content items as well as via aggregate information from the crowd's response. In this work we present a visual analytic tool, Vox Civitas, designed to help journalists and media professionals extract news value from large-scale aggregations of social media content around broadcast events. We discuss the design of the tool, present the text analysis techniques used to enable the presentation, and provide details on the visual and interaction design. We provide an exploratory evaluation based on a user study in which journalists interacted with the system to explore and report on a dataset of over one hundred thousand twitter messages collected during the U.S. State of the Union presidential address in 2010.},

  abstract={This article proposes a procedural content generator which evolves Minecraft buildings according to an open-ended and intrinsic definition of novelty. To realize this goal, we evaluate individuals’ novelty in the latent space using a 3-D autoencoder (AE), and alternate between phases of exploration and transformation. During exploration the system evolves multiple populations of CPPNs through CPPN-NEAT and constrained novelty search in the latent space (defined by the current AE). We apply a set of repair and constraint functions to ensure candidates adhere to basic structural rules during evolution. During transformation, we reshape the boundaries of the latent space to identify new interesting areas of the solution space by retraining the AE with novel content. In this study, we evaluate five different approaches for training the AE during transformation and its impact on populations’ quality and diversity during evolution. Our results show that by retraining the AE we can achieve better open-ended complexity compared to a static model, which is further improved when retraining using larger datasets of individuals with diverse complexities.},

  abstract={High-end manufacturing systems are cyber-physical systems, where productivity depends on the close cooperation of mechanical (physical) and scheduling (cyber) aspects. Mechanical and control constraints impose minimal and maximal time differences between events in the product flow. Sequence-dependent constraints are used by a scheduler to optimize system productivity while satisfying operational requirements. The numerous constraints in a schedule are typically related to a relatively small set of parameters, such as speeds, lengths, or settling times. We contribute a parametric critical path algorithm that identifies bottlenecks in terms of the feasible parameter combinations. This algorithm allows analysis of schedules to identify bottlenecks in terms of the underlying cause of constraints. We also contribute a way to find Pareto-optimal cost-performance tradeoffs and their associated parameter combinations. These results are used to quantify the impact of relaxing constraints that hinder system productivity.},

  abstract={We utilise a longitudinal dataset of 17 526 speech samples collected from 30 patients with major depressive disorder and 11 sub-clinically depressed individuals to perform a personalised prediction of depressed mood. The data has been recorded via a smartphone app over a two-week ecological momentary assessment with three recording sessions per day. Each session's speech samples are accompanied by a self-assessed rating on the discrete visual analogue mood scale (VAMS) from 0-10. As these ratings are highly subjective, a personalised machine learning method is leveraged. For this purpose, the beginning of the recording period is utilised to train both a shared model backbone, and adapt personalised layers added at the end to each speaker's speech. Our approach yields a Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) of 0.79 on the test set, compared to the non-personalised baseline of p=0.61. Furthermore, we analyse our results with regard to the type of speech sample - reading three depression-related questions, answering them, and freely formulating an uplifting spontaneous thought. Here, we find that personalisation boosts performance across all types, especially for the fixed content question readings. Overall, our work highlights the efficacy of personalised machine learning for depressed mood monitoring.},

  abstract={Analyses and syntheses are a pair of fundamental cognitive processes at the meta-inference layer of the brain. This paper presents the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis as a part of the brain’s inference mechanisms. The cognitive foundations of analysis and synthesis are explored, and their mathematical models are created in concept algebra and system algebra by concept and/or system decomposition, composition, specification, and aggregation. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models, the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis are formally described in Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA). The formal modeling and rigorous explanation of this pair of cognitive processes for formal inference reveal a part of the mechanisms of the brain as modeled in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB).},
