  abstract={In this paper, we present the KnowledgeSeeker, an ontological agent-based system that is designed to help users find, retrieve, and analyze news article from the Internet and then present the content in a semantic web. We present the benefits of using ontologies to analyze the semantics of Chinese text, and also the advantages of using a semantic web to organize information semantically. KnowledgeSeeker also demonstrates the advantages of using ontologies to identify topics. We use a Chinese document corpus to evaluate KnowledgeSeeker and the testing result was compared to other approaches. KnowledgeSeeker is able to identify the topics of Chinese web articles with an accuracy of nearly 87% and has a processing speed of less than one second per article. It is also able to organize content flexibly and understands knowledge more accurately than methods that use ontology definition.},

  pages={28-33},
  abstract={Courses to train modeling competence are held in higher educational institutions. These courses focus on the final artifacts submitted by learners for analysis and/or evaluation and do not clarify the intermediate creation process. This study focuses on quality of the final class diagram submitted by learners and trials and errors during the creation process. We tried to verify a hypothesis that learners to create an artifact with good quality make a number of trials and errors during the editing process. We collected the fine-grained data regarding the editing history of class diagrams created by learners by our tool called KIfU. We verified the hypothesis by analyzing the collected data. First, we defined two metrics ("Number of editing" and "Number of movement" of symbols in the artifact) calculated from the data that show the learners' trials and errors. Second, we divided learners into two groups, group that created artifacts with good quality and that with not good quality. Finally, we compared the metrics between the groups. The results show that there are statistically significantly differences of values of both metrics between the groups. We conclude the hypothesis we set is correct from the result.},

  abstract={Vocabulary acquisition has become a critical criterion in English learning. The present vocabulary learning strategy is rather primitive and inefficient as most students learning new words by rote recitation. Mind Maps, a technique to organize and express knowledge visually and hierarchically might be a new strategy for vocabulary learning. This paper attempts to demonstrate the problems that most Chinese students face in vocabulary acquisition, analyze the theoretical foundations of mindmaps and outline the patterns of vocabulary mind maps in vocabulary learning.},

  abstract={The organizational future outlined in this article portends both exciting opportunities and substantial challenges. In the process of moving beyond the rigidities of traditional organizational models, aided by computer and communications technology, we will inevitably encounter the tension between the creativity of new organizational models and the potential chaos of substantial change. Those who can foster and take advantage of the creativity while also avoid being trapped by the chaos will prosper. The key to dealing with this inherent tension involves understanding and supporting new approaches to organization, planning, and control. These approaches need to deal with issues of assessing and monitoring business situations; predicting the impacts of alternative ventures, relationships, and investments; and obtaining, deploying, and redeploying resources. Of particular importance, these approaches need to be researched, developed, and adapted to loosely-structured organizational models.},

  abstract={With the development of internet in China, Miccroblogging provides a new platform for communicating and sharing information among Web users. Users can express opinions and record daily life using microblogs. Microblogs that are posted by users indicate their interests to some extent. But it seems very hard to analyze the sentiment hided in Chinese Micro text because of its complexity. This paper proposes a new way to determine the sentiment tendency of Chinese micro text based on the partitioned Sense Group (STDSG). When to judge the sentiment tendency of Micro text, we first partition it into separate sense group, and then determine it's sentiment tendency based on Emotional Dictionary. And We aslo consider various factors which contain negations, degree adverbs and punctuations. The effectiveness of STDSG is strongly supported by the results of our experiments.},

  abstract={The advancement in technology related to artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot topic of debate in recent years. One concern is the possibility of job loss when machines with algorithms take over tasks that formerly required human labour. It analyses the implications of artificial intelligence technologies on the job market, paying particular attention to how it can decrease the demand for physical labour and perhaps oust employees from their professions. The distribution of wealth, salaries, efficiency, and job abilities are all areas where AI has the capability to have a significant impact. The paper also looks at the ethical implications of AI, such as how it will impact privacy, bias, and decision-making. The study outlines the potential dangers and benefits of AI on work and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders to lessen adverse effects and realize the potential benefits of AI through a thorough analysis of the available literature and case studies. The study concludes that AI can change how work is done and that proactive steps must be taken to solve potential problems and take full advantage of the opportunities that AI presents. Overall, the present study provides an in-depth knowledge of how AI will impact the workplace, placing a strong focus on the potential for job displacement and creation, the impact on salaries and output, and the need for ethical considerations.},

  abstract={Ontology is the basis component of the Semantic Web. Since constructing ontologies is a time consuming job for domain experts, many researches are conducted on automatic extraction of ontologies from texts. As the development of folksonomy, more and more researchers have realized that folksonomy is a better knowledge source for constructing ontologies than texts. Although some works have already been proposed to extract ontologies from folksonomies, these works have little consideration on what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, and lack an principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human's perspective. According to the study in cognitive psychology, there is a family of concepts named basic level concepts, which are frequently used by people in daily life, and most human knowledge is expressed using basic level concepts. In this paper, inspired by studies in cognitive psychology, we try to extract ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on discovering basic level concepts in folksonomies and using them to construct ontologies.},

  abstract={With its broad application areas of exceptional social and economic value, digital image processing has gained wide popularity as an undergraduate course for students majoring in Computer Science and Technology. Also, it has stepped into many application-oriented colleges, which differ from common universities in teaching goals and characteristics of students. This paper presents some new teaching methods of Digital Image Processing in an application-oriented college. In classroom presentation, more vivid illustrations and less formula derivations are given. While in laboratory exercises, students are instructed to develop some basic image processing functions commonly used in daily digital lives. This acts as a main clue for the whole course: with the progress of classroom teaching, various image processing features are gradually added to the softwares developed by students themselves. Following these methods, students are stimulated and remarkable teaching results are achieved.},

The implementation of green packaging can reduce pollution, optimize the environment, improve international competitiveness, promote the development of export trade, and is also conducive to the implementation of sustainable development strategies. However, despite the existence and benefits of this concept, China has weak green packaging legislation, a lack of relevant financial and technical expertise, a serious shortage of green packaging and other factors, that are hindering the full implementation of its green packaging strategy. To promote the development of green logistics and the implementation of the green packaging strategy, progress will have to be made both by the government and enterprises. The government should focus on strengthening the legal system, giving policy support and also using tax leverage, whereas enterprises should strengthen green packaging awareness, implement green packaging labels and use green packaging materials.},

Tutor robots offer new opportunities for curriculum development, motivating students, stimulating interest and developing soft skills, while preparing young people to use the latest technological tools. In our online survey, conducted in summer 2022, we explored the views of educators in 14 countries on the characteristics of robot-supported innovation in higher education. The results of the survey show that educators are open to educational innovations. Educational robots are mainly used for teaching programming. They believe that the use of social robots significantly improves students’ creativity and self-expression. The results of this research have shown that the use of educational social robots is an excellent opportunity for methodological innovation and provides scope for experimental teaching.},

The current representative method of product definition applies situation based control of product feature parameters. In the presented method, application of situation control was improved by placing it from the product feature level to the product behavior level. Because the feature level situation control is a proven key technology in product lifecycle management systems, the new behavior level product definition process controls the process of the feature level product definition. This paper starts with a comparison of the feature and the behavior level product feature definition. Following this, the product request, product behavior, and context structure feature definitions are introduced as main elements of the behavior level product feature definition process. Next, a new context structure and its connection with the feature sequence is exampled and discussed. Finally, application of the proposed method in product lifecycle management systems is outlined.},

  abstract={The idea of brain machine interface (BMI) is to provide a source of interaction between a person and a machine via thought. Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.},

  abstract={This paper explores the intersection of historical exploration, gamification, and immersive technologies to enhance engagement and learning in history education. Traditional methods of historical inquiry often struggle to captivate learners' interest, particularly in an era dominated by digital experiences. Gamification, incorporating game elements into non-game contexts, has shown promise in fostering engagement and motivation. This study delves into the potential benefits of leveraging immersive gamification to create dynamic and captivating historical exploration experiences. The theoretical framework draws upon educational theories, game design principles, and the evolving landscape of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. We examine the limitations of traditional historical education methods and discuss how gamification can address these challenges by providing interactive and participatory learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper outlines fundamental design principles for creating immersive historical exploration scenarios, emphasising the importance of narrative structure, game mechanics, and user engagement. Through case studies, we highlight successful applications of immersive gamification in historical education, presenting outcomes and insights gained from these implementations. Challenges and considerations in integrating immersive gamification into historical exploration are also explored, including ethical considerations and accessibility issues. The paper concludes by proposing future directions for research in this emerging field, anticipating the continued evolution of technologies and pedagogical approaches.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in interest and challenges in image processing and pattern recognition, specifically in the context of air writing. This exciting research area has significant potential to advance automation processes and improve human-machine interfaces in various applications. The emergence of faster computers, affordable high-performance video cameras, and the need for automated analysis of videos has led to an increase in the popularity of object tracking, a critical task in computer vision. The process of video analysis typically encompasses object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis. Object tracking involves four main aspects choosing the suitable object representation, selecting features for tracking, detecting the object, and tracking the object. Object tracking algorithms find applications in different domains, including vehicle navigation, video indexing, and surveillance that are automated. The objective of the paper is to create a software application for smart wearable devices that utilizes computer vision to track finger gestures in the air, functioning as a motion-to-text converter for air-writing. The technology will facilitate communication for people by enabling them to generate text for multiple purposes, like sending emails and messages, through intermittent gestures. This is a productive means of communication that curbs the usage of laptops and mobiles, making it particularly beneficial for individuals who are deaf.},

  abstract={Music is a Universal Language that influences human emotions, mood and even physiological responses, making it a powerful tool in media, therapy, and entertainment. The increasing interest in AI-generated music that targets specific emotions faces challenges due to current technology's inability to control emotional expression effectively. As a result, AI struggles to create music that truly resonates with listeners on an emotional level. This research addresses this gap by introducing a method that combines transformer models with fuzzy logic to enhance AI's emotional expressiveness in music composition. This approach involves training a transformer model on mood-labeled music to capture correlations between musical features and emotions. Integrating fuzzy logic enables fine-tuning of elements like tempo and dynamics, allowing for precise adjustments that enhance the models ability for composing music that exactly relates the given mood. The result is a system that generates music with given mood. The outcomes show that this model successfully produces emotionally resonant music, refining mood accuracy with each iteration. This project combines automated music generation with mood-based composition allowing for personalized, emotionally attuned music experiences. This project demonstrates how AI can support musicians and creators by helping produce music that matches specific moods, that relates to individual preferences. Beyond art, it makes personalized music possible in areas like entertainment, and therapy, offering people music that fits their emotional needs.},

  abstract={In the course of creating and analyzing music content, artificial intelligence systems are widely used, and according to the forecasts of analysts, their use in the field of music will grow steadily. Modern artificial intelligence systems successfully solve problems that cause difficulties for humans. However, these systems lack the ability to create and evaluate the semantics of musical works the same way as humans do. The problem of creating musical artificial intelligence with the creative abilities of the human mind is one of the most topical and complex problems in the music industry. The solution to this problem in the first place lies in studying and understanding the essence of the term “Musical Sense”. The purpose of the study is to develop a concept for the probabilistic assessment of the musical texts' semantics based on the concepts of information theory and information technologies. To achieve the goal, a convergent approach to the study of the problem of musical meaning, proposed by Professor A. B. Kayak, was used. As a result of the completed study, the main conceptual provisions of the theory of probabilistic evaluation of musical senses have been developed. The article is of a theoretical nature. However, the materials of the article may be of practical interest for researchers of the problem of sense and developers of artificial intelligence in the music industry.},
