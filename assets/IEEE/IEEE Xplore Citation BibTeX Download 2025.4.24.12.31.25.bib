  abstract={This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

  abstract={This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={8072-8076},
  abstract={Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.},

  abstract={The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.},

  abstract={Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={The testability of equipment has become the key factor affecting equipment availability, and detracts from readiness and mission success. To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.},

When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.},

This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics the job outlook for computer scientists and engineers is stellar for the long term-President Obama and industry leaders encouraged colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year. Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.},

  abstract={A description is given of a systolic Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm for Boolean n-cubes with a substantial amount of storage per cube node. In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>},

  abstract={Contrast with the increasing social demands for senior application-oriented talents, the corresponding training and education are far left behind. Drawing on the experiences in cooperation with our German counterparts, and in close combination of teaching activities in the mode of open-ended project-based learning, we propose to apply the open-ended project-based learning mode into experiments of information and computational sciences. Its contents, characteristics, as well as practical achievements are clearly elaborated. We focus our research and analysis on the resources of experiment projects, organization, environment, and effectiveness of the open-ended experiment-project-based learning mode. It is revealed that the unique characteristics of this learning mode is its open nature, which enables the students to freely and actively select the supervisors, partners, learning environment, as well as high-quality projects.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.},
