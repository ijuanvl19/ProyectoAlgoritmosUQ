  abstract={The deadly COVID-19 coupled with other diseases has proven to be the biggest challenge humans have seen in ages. Healthcare systems, even in the most developed countries, have completely shattered during the peak of waves. Thus, leaving millions rendered helpless and alone around the globe. This proves the importance of self-care and immunity to being the best possible way for being healthy. Solutions specific to strengthening immunity are available in the Indian sciences of Yoga and Ayurveda and has been scientifically proven. These have been around in India for ages but there is an immense lack of awareness in India and around the globe regarding that. This review paper aims at filling the lack of awareness by proposing a model and validating it further by collecting and comparing the pre and post-implementation data.},

  abstract={Emotion is a kind of psychological activity that accompanies human beings. Emotion plays an important role in high-level cognitive behavior, such as decision making and learning. The goal of affective computing is to give computers the ability to perceive, understand, and express emotions. With the introduction of affective computing technology, agents have the ability to simulate and humanoid emotions. Based on self-consciousness of emotion computing in intelligent model (AORBCO), analysis of the current development and problems of emotion computing, is proposed based on self-awareness of emotion computing, the basic idea of emotional calculation method is given, and the emotional knowledge base is established, using knowledge weight change and updating knowledge base Ebbinghaus's law.

  abstract={The key technique of virtual prototyping is real-time a performance simulation for a product, such as virtual assembly simulation and mechanism movement simulation. However, the key to realize this simulation is yet the representation of a product model, and but, the traditional digital model of a product (such as relation model and hierarchical model) doesn't meet the demand. Therefore, this paper provides a scene graph model of a digital product based on DAG. The definition of the scene graph model is given and the features to represent a virtual product with DAG are analyzed o Finally, the principles of dynamically assembling and disassembling product with DAG and its simulating method are explained with an example.},

  year={2000},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={211-218},
  abstract={The ability to predict the performance of a simulation application before its implementation is an important factor for the adoption of parallel simulation technology in industry. Ideally, a simulationist estimates the inherent parallelism of a simulation problem to determine whether it is worthwhile to invest resources to carry out a parallel simulation. We propose an analytic method for predicting the simulation parallelism of a simulation problem that is independent of implementation details. We assume that the system to be simulated is modelled as a network of logical processes, and each logical process models a queuing server center. Unlike many analytic models reported in the literature, we consider the causal relations among events in a simulation. Causality effects reduce event parallelism. Our proposed analytic method gives a tighter upper bound on performance speedup. Validation experiments show that our analytic prediction of simulation parallelism differs from that of critical path analysis by 2.9% and 18.8% in open and closed systems respectively.},

This inquiry learning educational method helps to cultivate all-round developed students. This paper probes into constructing a more interesting and efficient learning environment by computer simulation through MCGS, which provides a motivating and student-oriented platform for performing laboratory experiments. Student-oriented experiments enable students to have better understanding of what they have learned in class. Student-oriented design process also constructs efficient self-development environment to cultivate students' creativity, practicing skill, innate ability and personality. Results indicate that students enjoy learning through student-oriented experiments based on MCGS. It also helps to cultivate students' engineering idea which is beneficial to students' career development.},

  year={2024},

  pages={228-233},
  abstract={Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions through modal features such as acoustic, text, and visual modalities. Although existing multimodal emotion recognition algorithms have achieved good performance, in many tasks, features are extracted from the same video for acoustic, text, and visual modalities, which will lead to redundant information across modalities. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms. Ablation experiments show that the input sequence of modality affects the model's performance, with the model achieving optimal performance when the input sequence is visual features, speech features, text features, and personality features.},

  abstract={Handwriting is a unique characteristic that distinguishes a person's identity and serves as a method for identifying various physical and psychological attributes of the writer. It reflects genuine personality traits, including behavior, emotional responses, self-perception, creativity, honesty, fears, and many other characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered approach for analyzing personality traits through handwriting analysis, utilizing a Voting Classifier, which integrates predictions from multiple base models to enhance overall performance. Specifically, our Voting Classifier combines Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Each base model is carefully tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters such as regularization strength for Logistic Regression, kernel type for Support Vector Machine, and number of estimators for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers. The model's performance evaluation reveals impressive results, with a 93% accuracy in classifying handwriting samples. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness and its ability to handle various handwriting styles with consistency. The strong accuracy underscores the model's potential for real-world applications, offering trustworthy insights into personality traits through handwriting analysis.},

  abstract={It may be possible for a deaf person and a hearing person to converse over the telephone. The deaf user "speaks" by typing to a text-to-speech converter using a low-redundancy keyboard system. The hearing user speaks sentences one word at a time to a large-vocabulary, isolated-word-recognition system that displays a sentence lattice (a sequence of sets of likely matches for each word spoken). The deaf user then tries to find a sensible path through the sentence lattice. Successful implementation of such a system, under development at SRI International, requires adequate performance in text generation speed by deaf users, text-to-speech intelligibility, and word-at-a-time speaking by hearing users, as well as large-vocabulary speech recognition and disambiguation of sentence lattices by deaf users.},

  abstract={Early childhood is a golden period for the development of a person’s learning ability, and educating children about objects in early childhood can cultivate their ability to recognize common things and objects in life. Early childhood object education can promote children’s ability to recognize and understand things. At present, there are common problems in kindergartens such as "difficulty in identifying objects" and "uninteresting in identifying objects". In this context, the article adopted a preschool object recognition education scheme based on FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection) algorithm, and achieved good results in practical teaching. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the FCOS algorithm based method for early childhood object recognition education reached up to 95.1%. From this, it can be concluded that applying FCOS to early childhood object education enables young children to accurately recognize things around them in real life, improves their ability to recognize common things in life, and is beneficial for cultivating their observation and creativity, which has a positive effect on their growth.},
