  abstract={Recent advancement in neural language models has witnessed many applications in writing instruction and assessment, including automated writing assessment in secondary and post-secondary education. Using language models for student writing assessment brings promises of increased accuracy, speed, and objectivity in evaluating student writing, benefiting writing students and teachers. Based on our case study using sentence-level prediction in Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) assessment of College Writing 1 and 2 courses at the Florida Atlantic University (FAU), we argue in this paper that automatic writing assessment should be implemented at the sentence level. We collected end-of-semester argumentative essays, which were then systematically evaluated at the sentence- and the whole-document level. The study shows how neural language models can achieve a certain level of accuracy, but scoring inconsistency is a significant challenge to the learning model. We propose solutions to address such inconsistency, and also report important findings from the case study.},

  title={Modular Representation of Components to Enable Generative Engineering}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Generative design of engineering systems has been applied across various fields, including robotics, electronics, and architecture. Usually involving design grammars, a common challenge in all these approaches has been data and design representation. Design grammars also demand significant human input for development, are limited in scope, and require iterative testing to be fully applicable to a design problem. This paper introduces the concept of engineering component modularity, inspired by the modularity of words. The concept is presented in context of a generative design framework driven by a knowledge graph database. Additionally, a technical representation based on standardized practices is proposed, enabling the creation and simulation of software agnostic system architecture designs. This work is limited to the component representation, with the generation process itself, and the proposed capability to learn from the evaluated results, left for future research. The groundwork established here impacts the development of generative system design frameworks by enabling self-sustainable and robust autonomous design which requires minimal human inter-vention. It thus offers a tool for unbiased, efficient design space exploration. While previous research has addressed generative system design, the novelty of this approach lies in the use of a knowledge graph database in place of design grammar, combined with an integrated standardized simulation framework for more comprehensive evaluation.},

  abstract={This research introduces an approach named “Cloud-Driven Personalized Experience Enhancement” to satisfy the escalating demand for enhanced digital connectivity. Via cutting-edge cloud services and applications, the CPExE framework provides a groundbreaking solution for digital platforms. The framework is built upon three core components: Together with the Quantum-Inspired Data Analytics and Evaluation (QIDAE) and Personalized Content Recommendations (PRA), Dynamic Resource Allocation and Adaptation (DRAA) completes the framework. By leveraging quantum-inspired approaches, QIDAE analyzes vast datasets with outstanding effectiveness and exactness improving processes for data handling and personalization. This strategy allows for swift detection of patterns while making certain that data-driven understandings are both on time and precise. By changing cloud resources according to user requests the DRAA module guarantees uninterrupted access to computing power and data storage. By managing resources effectively in real-time it decreases latency and improves service speeds. By using complex algorithms to assess user habits and choices the PRA system boosts the digital experience. PRA uses both content-focused filtering and collaborative screening strategies to provide users with engaging content that matches their unique preferences. By applying sophisticated analytics and resource management methods with content personalization CPExE boosts the user experience and develops cloud technology efficiency. This framework signifies an important progress toward developing dynamic and tailored online environments.},

  abstract={Integrating robotics and automation technologies into architectural design and fabrication is an emerging field with immense trans formative potential. Robotic fabrication techniques broaden new horizons for architectural representation, allowing the creation of intricate detailing, complex geometries, and precise design execution. This technological advancement, however, also necessitates the development of innovative skills and knowledge among architecture students to harness these capabilities effectively. The workshop described in this research serves as a gateway, introducing students to the fundamental principles of robotics, including robot arm kinematics, end-effector positioning, motion planning algorithms, and trajectory generation. It adopted a project-based learning approach, where students developed their parametric design scripts and delved into robotic drawing and movie-making using physical models from their studio projects. Throughout the workshops via physical and virtual environments, students were encouraged to embrace an exploratory and research-oriented mindset, viewing the exercises as opportunities for experimentation and learning rather than solely focusing on producing a final output. This approach fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between architecture, engineering, and computer science disciplines, empowering students to critically analyze the outcomes of robotic drawing and fabrication and their implications for architectural representation.},

  year={2011},
  volume={4},
  number={1},
  pages={35-46},
  abstract={This study presents a conceptual framework for providing intelligent supports through agent negotiation and fuzzy constraints to enhance the effectiveness of peer assessment. By using fuzzy constraints, it not only provides a flexible marking scheme to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty for the representation of assessment but also provides a computational framework to incorporate student's personal characteristics into the process for the reduction of assessment bias. Additionally, a fuzzy constraint-based negotiation mechanism is employed to coordinate the cognitive differences between students. Through iterative agent negotiation, students can reconcile the differences and reach an agreement on the assessment results. Thus, the proposed framework allows students to provide more detailed, informed, and less biased assessments for their peers' work. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, a negotiation-based peer assessment system, NePAS, has been built and used in classroom. Experimental results suggested that students were more willing to accept the assessment results and able to acquire more useful information to reflect upon and revise their work. Instructors can also observe students' participation and performance to appropriately adjust instructional strategies.},

A Web science observatory exemplifies this relationship by offering an online platform of tools for carrying out Web science research, allowing users to carry out data science techniques to produce insights into Web science issues such as community development, online behavior, and information propagation.

  abstract={Creativity and insight are distinctive attributes of human cognition, but their neural basis remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of experimental study. As such, computational modeling can play an important role in understanding these phenomena. Some researchers have proposed that creative individuals have a “deeper” organization of knowledge, allowing them to connect remote associates and form novel ideas. It is reasonable to assume that the depth and richness of semantic organization in individual minds is related to the connectivity of neural networks involved in semantic representation. In this paper, we use a simple and plausible neurodynamical model of semantic networks to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. This work is motivated, in part, by research showing that experimentally obtained semantic networks have a specific connectivity pattern that is both small-world and scale-free. We show that neural semantic networks reflecting this structure have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures. Though simple, this model may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind - its capacity for creative thought.},

  abstract={This paper illustrates a 10-year research endeavor on collective learning, a paradigm for tackling tragedy of the commons problems in socio-technical systems using human-centered distributed intelligence. In contrast to mainstream centralized artificial intelligence (AI) allowing algorithmic discrimination and manipulative nudging, the decentralized approach of collective learning is by-design participatory and value-sensitive: it aligns with privacy, autonomy, fairness and democratic values. Engineering such values in a socio-technical system results in computational constraints that turn collective decision-making into complex combinatorial NP-hard problems. These are the problems that collective learning and the EPOS research project tackles. Collective learning finds striking applicability in energy, traffic, supply-chain and the self-management of sharing economies. This grand applicability and the social impact are demonstrated in this paper along with a future perspective of the collective learning paradigm.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a computational framework for automated story-based scenario generation. Under this framework, a regular grammar is developed to model various causal relationships inside a given story world. The grammar is then evolved using evolutionary computation techniques to generate novel story plots, i.e. story-based scenarios. To evaluate these newly generated scenarios, a human-in-the-loop model is used. An experimental study was carried out, in which the proposed framework was used to create novel plots based on the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. The experimental study demonstrated that evolutionary computation can potentially contribute significantly to story generations. Some challenges were identified including the difficulty to quantify such subjective measures as plot interestingness and creativity.},

  abstract={The development of analytical skills is a central goal of the Next Generation Science Standards and foundational to subject mastery in STEM fields. Yet, significant barriers exist to students gaining such skills. Here we describe a new “gentle-slope” cyberlearning strategy that gradually introduces students to the authoring of scientific simulations via a Web-based modding approach called CyberMOD. Modding involves adding agents with predefined functionality to a simulation world to produce a unique combination whose behavior can then be visualized by running the simulation. This permits low barrier experimentation on the modded simulation, which is hoped to help students gain a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena that is the focus of the activity. Our research questions are: i) does this approach encourage students' interest in computational science and ii) does it enhance their analytical abilities, and iii) does it foster a deeper understanding of the processes modded? Here we take an in-depth look at what was created for the CyberMOD infrastructure and analyze the results of initial in-class studies as to the effectiveness of this strategy. The results support the premise that teachers can easily integrate CyberMOD into their in-class activities, that CyberMOD activities encourage creative student learning, and that the CyberMOD approach facilitates student understanding.},

  abstract={As social robots and other intelligent machines enter the home, artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) is taking center stage to address users’ desire for deeper, more meaningful human-machine interaction. To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages–Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.},

  abstract={We previously measured human performance on a complex problem-solving task that involves finding which ball in a set is lighter or heavier than the others with a limited number of weightings. None of the participants found a correct solution within 30 minutes without help of demonstrations or instructions. In this paper, we model human performance on this task using a biologically plausible computational model based on reinforcement learning. We use a SARSA-based Softmax learning algorithm where the reward function is learned using cascade-correlation neural networks. First, we find that the task can be learned by reinforcement alone with substantial training. Second, we study the number of alternative actions available to Softmax and find that 5 works well for this problem which is compatible with estimates of human working memory size. Third, we find that simulations are less accurate than humans given equivalent amount of training We suggest that humans use means-ends analysis to self-generate rewards in non-terminal states. Implementing such self-generated rewards might improve model accuracy. Finally, we pretrain models to prefer simple actions, like humans. We partially capture a simplicity bias, and find that it had little impact on accuracy.},

  abstract={In this study, we investigate how a robot can generate novel and creative actions from its own experience of learning basic actions. Inspired by a machine learning approach to computational creativity, we propose a dynamic neural network model that can learn and generate robot's actions. We conducted a set of simulation experiments with a humanoid robot. The results showed that the proposed model was able to learn the basic actions and also to generate novel actions by modulating and combining those learned actions. The analysis on the neural activities illustrated that the ability to generate creative actions emerged from the model's nonlinear memory structure self-organized during training. The results also showed that the different way of learning the basic actions induced the self-organization of the memory structure with the different characteristics, resulting in the generation of different levels of creative actions. Our approach can be utilized in human-robot interaction in which a user can interactively explore the robot's memory to control its behavior and also discover other novel actions.},

  abstract={A review of recently published papers demonstrates: simulation practitioners apply the standard methods of inferential and descriptive statistics for their reasoning with simulation generated samples without much critical reflection. Yet, simulation-generated samples differ in important aspects from empirical samples, for which the standard statistical methods have been developed. Simulation models do have inherent epistemic and computational limits for replication that do not exist with empirical data sets. Consequently, neither is simulation-based data generation the same as the collection of empirical data nor is the analysis of synthetic data equally beneficial as of empirical data. These differences are much more fundamental for computer simulation than the problems of specific techniques of inferential statistics which have been criticized recently. If simulation generated data is used for testing research hypotheses the core issue is not the method of statistical reasoning but the assurance of what might be called evidential content.},

  abstract={The use of MapReduce (MR) model has attracted much attention because of the reductions in the costs involved in satisfying the storage and computational demands. However, authentication methods proposed for such model is subjected with rooms for improvements. In the initial design and implementation of the MR model such as Hadoop, issues of security including authentication was not considered. It was assumed that the underlying system worked in a trustworthy environment, so MR developers did not provide authentication methods in the MR model. This assumption is still valid to some extent, whereas major IT players in the world, such as Facebook and Yahoo have implemented the MR model in their private clouds. However, recently there are efforts to provide the MR model in public clouds. Inadequate authentication methods for the MR model in such environment makes the job execution work-flow vulnerable to many attacks such as impersonation and spoofing attacks. So as part of our work to design a secure and effective authentication solution for the MR model, this paper examines and critically analyses the state-of-the-art in MR authentication methods against a general set of specified requirements. It is to identify limitations, weaknesses, and missing features in the proposed authentication methods for the MR model.},

  abstract={In this computational study for acquiring syntactic containment constructions, we suggest that emergent structures in the sensorimotor space may help limit the search for linguistic patterns to a much smaller corpus, in which the earliest glimmerings of syntax may originate. We consider an early learner exposed to perceptual data (video) with co-occurring word-segmented commentaries. In the initial stages of an incremental statistical learning process, content words (e.g. object names) are acquired. Then, some prototypical containment categories emerge by clustering spatial relations in the perceptual input. These situational regularities are used to focus only on sentences uttered during containment situations. By using k-gram and path alignment models on this limited corpus, we show that such a system may begin to learn word categories as well as syntacto-semantic constructions such as “into the X”/[IN(tr,X)]. A key step in the process is the structure in which this perceptual knowledge is organized. The term “image schema” has often been used to refer to such structures, but has widely divergent interpretations. We view the image schema as a category oracle; initially limited to spatio-temporal situation, it may extend, with increasing exposure to language, to new situations.},

  abstract={The presence of artificial agents in human social networks is growing. From chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a socio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition. These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in social-psychological and sociological theory.},

  abstract={The increasing computational demands of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, particularly for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles and drones, present significant challenges owing to their extensive neural network complexities. Previous DRL compression strategies predominantly focused on unstructured pruning, effective for reducing model size but requiring specialized hardware for computational acceleration. Conversely, DRL models with structured pruning applied can be accelerated on standard hardware, though they typically encounter performance issues at higher pruning rates due to structural constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced structured pruning methodology, combined with scaled policy constraints (SPC) for DRL models. Our approach overcomes the performance limitations of conventional structured pruning, achieving high pruning rates while maintaining robust model performance. Enhanced performance restoration after pruning is achieved by fine-tuning with SPC and applying structural regularization, thus ensuring efficient decision-making with a minimal computational burden. Extensive evaluations on the D4RL benchmark and in a drone control simulation environment confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our approach maintains performance integrity even at high pruning rates, with less than a 2% decrease in normalized score at 90% pruning in D4RL and preserving cumulative reward at 87% pruning in drone control simulation. Significantly, our approach also enables considerable computational acceleration on standard hardware. We implemented our method on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board and achieved a 2.5-fold speed-up on devices with NVIDIA Volta GPUs and over double the speed-up on those with NVIDIA Carmel ARMv8.2 CPUs. These outcomes highlight our method’s suitability for real-time, resource-constrained applications, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency.},

  abstract={To explore the possibility of evolving grounded artificial languages for creative design, this paper presents an approach to evolving mappings between spatial relations between simple shapes and artificial utterances. An implementation of this approach is presented, which combines Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The results from experiments with this implementation have shown that the transformation between artificial language and design concepts can be realised and the hybrid computational system could be utilised in curious design agents for the evolution of artificial language in computational language games.},

  abstract={The development of social media in the form of websites and android applications should be appreciated. The background of this research is the stage to develop the software needed to know the age range. The objective thing to observe is through the visitor’s face on the web or application. The purpose is to avoid false information and get the proper process flow. The Technology used is deep learning for facial image recognition. The methods use Convolutional Neural Network with residuals because the advantage is using multi-branch layers but having a stable training process. The use of augmentation is needed to increase the variety of facial recognition image positions and to overcome unbalanced classes. The dataset used consists of seven categories, namely Children, Youth, Early Workers, Middle Ages, Pre-Retirement, Retirement, and Old People, which Bappenas regulate. Each folder contains about 1157 images with a total data of 8,105 images. The training process results can obtain a model with an average accuracy of 99.08% and a computational training time of about three hundred minutes. The model’s accuracy is 99.08%, with MSE 0.0037, RMSE 0.0610, and MAE 0.0037. Testing time is about 2 seconds.},
