  abstract={Human cognition stems from his identifying the relationship or relative distance between himself and any other objects or persons, for which prerequisite is establishing his 'self'. In other words, it is presumable that the potential of intelligent machine's establishing its 'self' would require us to engineer its sense of 'ego' and 'intention', which involves such factors as 'emotions', 'instincts', and 'sensibilities'. This dissertation introduces the psycho-quantum theory which illustrates the human psychodynamics by the quantum mechanics approach, and its application for constructing the distribution model of emotional modalities and the autonomous system, the essential elements for creating an ego in a computer. We have attempted to create the artificial 'ego' and 'desire' based on our probability model and state transition analysis, then accordingly developed our methodology of the artificial thought process as well as the judging mechanism of such computer. Furthermore, this dissertation introduces the sensibility inference function of our psycho-quantum computer, by which we discuss our methods to itemize 126 emotional modalities of human, construct the three-dimensional dynamic model of emotions, and analyze the emotion distribution and its longitudinal modal transition so as to derive the artificial instinct and to determine/infer its relationship with external factors. Currently, our technology to construct the comprehensive psycho-quantum computer is yet in developmental stage; however, its potential is enormous so that it will constitute a key technology in new robotics industry.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The educational system's trajectory has shifted dramatically in recent years. The introduction of chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has mostly pushed the trend. Fundamentally, these methods are intended to improve the culture and experience of teaching and learning. However, there are risks associated with these technologies. The risks of using AI chatbots in the education of future engineering graduates are severely examined in this systematic review. This review identifies and addresses pedagogical, ethical, technological, and socio-cultural dangers that may come from the widespread use of AI chatbots based on an intensive review of the available research. The findings provide useful insights for educators, institutions, and policymakers as they manage the hurdles of implementing AI chatbots in engineering education responsibly.},

  abstract={As child-robot interactions become more and more common in daily life environment, it is important to examine how robot’s errors influence children’s behavior. We explored how a robot’s unexpected behaviors affect child-robot interactions during two workshops on active reading: one in a modern art museum and one in a school. We observed the behavior and attitudes of 42 children from three age groups: 6-7 years, 8-10 years, and 10-12 years. Through our observations, we identified six different types of surprising robot behaviors: personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays, and freezing. Using a qualitative analysis, we examined how children responded to each type of behavior, and we observed similarities and differences between the age groups. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots.},

  title={An Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={154-159},
  abstract={The human nervous system is the controlling mechanism for coordinating all body-related activities. In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.},

  title={Combining cognitive, semiotic and discourse analysis to explore the power of notations in visual programming}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={101-108},
  abstract={Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.},

  abstract={It is widely acknowledged that many freshmen go to university without any prior grounding in computer science. Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications. The paper outlines the course and its content in detail, as well as providing quantitative and qualitative evidence of its benefit and appeal to female students.},

Initial results indicate that traditional desktop applications are currently more engaging than VR for teaching programming. We thus identify the need for careful design of interaction methods to support ease of use and reward factors to promote engagement in VR-based learning applications beyond the initial wow-factor.},

  abstract={Our contemporary society necessitates professionals equipped with 21st-century skills. Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.},

  abstract={Several reasons have led to the widespread adoption of neural-based algorithms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), including their high performance, elegant model designs, and parallel computing capabilities. Numerous ASR models have been proposed to improve the recognition results, but the gains are still insufficient. This paper proposes a re-thinking ASR model, which aims to bridge the gap by rethinking the regularities of a given hypothesis and the relationship between text-level and acoustic-level characteristics of the input speech utterance. For the re-thinking ASR model, a mixed attention mechanism, a self-and-mixed attention mechanism, and a deep acoustic feature extractor are meticulously designed to enable the notion to be realized. A publicly available benchmark corpus is used to evaluate the proposed model. As the experimental results demonstrate, the proposed re-thinking ASR model can provide significant and consistent improvements over popular baseline systems.},

  year={2022},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={289-309},
  abstract={What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.},

  abstract={Social relationship is explained under the fuzzy set and fuzzy logic theory. A model for describing the individual nature of mind in the fuzzy environment is presented first, then extended for groups, couples, and social relationship dealing with both perfect and approximate reasoning. The fuzzy social relationship as proposed here also devise that goals of one individual may be seen as constraints upon others, and vice-versa. In this sense, the proposed fuzzy social relationship description is a special case of fuzzy decision-making in fuzzy environment. Moreover, the social relationship is, actually, a simple case of logic mapping. According to the fuzzy social model, the common sense and the advantage of being flexible is emphasized mainly one is interested in a social relationship and in avoiding conflicts. The proposed approach addresses not only human beings, yet it can be extended to describe a sociological perspective of relationship, as well as to overall relationship between societies, nations by including trading and diplomacy.},

  abstract={The importance of emotion has been identified in human-like intelligence recently. To improve the ability of agent for handling emotions, a new architecture for emotion agent is presented, based on the traditional BDI agent model. The architecture firstly establishes a new emotion knowledge base for emotion expression, secondly performs emotion reasoning by an emotional reasoning algorithm, and finally implements the emotion treatment. An emotional agent grid based on this architecture has been realized, experiment results show that it is efficient to transact simple emotions by emotional agents},

  pages={407-412},
  abstract={This paper highlighted the key challenges impacting Management Education in India (MEI) in the current digitalized scenario, especially after COVID-19. Initially, an exploratory research design was utilized and then it was descriptive to analyze the collected data. The sample size was 100(valid responses) being the management educator of Meerut city as a sample unit. Table & Descriptive Statistics were used to define the data and ‘Correlation and Multiple Regression Analysis’ were used for calculating the outcomes. Major respondents were young-aged educators that truly believe in a challenging and dynamic MEI as of now. The crisis management ability was the most crucial challenge of MEI. "Industry orientation" and "international perspective" were not significant challenges. The study was highly practical because "MEI" has been undergoing a roundabout transformation in the current digitalized scenario, and there has been a paradigm shift in overall higher education following COVID-19. It was highly important because budding managers and forthcoming business leaders have to perform in a highly dynamic environment, and the paper was original as 100 primary responses of management educators in Meerut City were taken into account for study.},
