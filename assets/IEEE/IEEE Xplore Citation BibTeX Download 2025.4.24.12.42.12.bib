  abstract={This study explains the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for `fun-based' interactive programming instruction in engineering education courses. Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.'},

  abstract={This paper discusses how Social Digital Literacy is being used in CS1 to teach critical and computational thinking by delivering content to students through the use of social media. Social Digital Literacy (SDL) is the way in which people use social media to enhance their social network, effectively increase their knowledge base, while communicating clearly and professionally through the use of social media. The increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. In order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. By increasing their SDL proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media. The expectation is that the approach being used can be implemented in any introductory programming course.},

  abstract={Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.},

  abstract={Mamdani inference model is widely used in that kind of engineering applications, in which imprecision, subjectivity, or uncertainty should be handled in the data and in the evaluation process. Its popularity is coming from its operation is very close to the human thinking. Although, it has high computational needs. Final step of the conventional model is the defuzzification, where a crisp value is assigned to the aggregated result of the system to represent it. This value should be selected in such a way as to best represent the result of the evaluation. For this reason, to select the best fitted defuzzification method is essential. In this paper two of the commonly used defuzzification methods are introduced, and a correction value is proposed to improve the result of MOM (Mean of Maxima) defuzzification method. The proposed modification was studied both in the conventional Mamdani, and Mamdani-like model using discretized output.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

In this special session, we report about several interesting approaches towards the design and creation of educational material that range from the call to the definition of a discipline of Courseware Engineering, to a methodology for video recording, another one for the creation of smart adaptive content, tools metrics for teaching computational thinking, the integration of OERs, and the design and application of game-based material.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},

  abstract={How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.},

It is also apparent that the amazing development of multimedia computer software and communication technologies have made more evident those weaknesses and, at the same time, have shown that many freshman students need to be trained, in order to use more efficiently the computational technology. In order to overcome these weaknesses, the authors have designed a long-term program in mathematics organized in stages and oriented to freshman engineering and architecture students. In the first stage, they ran two workshops incorporated to the regular first year maths course of engineering and architecture and developed in the classroom. In both workshops, they used cooperative learning techniques and divergent thinking methods. They also have developed a new assessment scheme to evaluate the students' performance. In the second stage they have offered a special course in mathematics for freshman architecture students that combines a traditional lecture format with "hands on" student's activities, i.e., by using multimedia resources and Internet tools as instructional media.},

The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.},

The results show that including women researchers in the course, which began in 2022, has positively affected young women's participation. The lack of women in the department's faculty until 2022 highlights the importance of recent efforts to promote gender diversity within the course and the wider academic environment, promoting positive practices for advancing gender equality in fields where disparities persist.},

  abstract={The modern technologies of fuzzy logic and neural networks are based on operations on truth values or degrees of class membership. They operate more closely to the manner that we currently believe humans use to think and control. Once you understand the underlying functionality you can find ways to apply the technologies to otherwise difficult to solve problems. If we take human thought and action as one baseline for intelligence, then neural nets, fuzzy logic and their hybrids can be seen as more intelligent platforms. These more intelligent tools allow users to re-frame the problem space to a larger systems view. An implementor no longer has to be concerned with the underlying physics of a system, or with control theory details. The problem space is expanded to a higher level while the lower level part is passed off to the core computational method. This paper proposes the effects of a whole new approach to problem solving enabled by neural/fuzzy technologies.},

  abstract={Classifying the cognitive levels of assessment questions according to Bloom’s taxonomy can help instructors design effective assessments that are well aligned with the intended learning outcomes. However, the classification process is time consuming and requires experience. Many studies have attempted to automate the process by utilizing different machine learning and text mining approaches, but none has examined the classification of Arabic questions. The purpose of this study is to examine this research gap and to introduce a new feature extraction method that would better suit Arabic questions and their unique characteristics. It also aims to provide Arab instructors with a tool that can help them automatically classify their assessment questions. To accomplish this purpose, the study developed a dataset of more than 600 Arabic assessment questions. It then proposed a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method for extracting features from Arabic questions. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, the proposed method was designed to take the nature of assessment questions into consideration. It was evaluated by comparing it to two methods that have been used for classifying English questions, i.e., the traditional TF-IDF and a modified TF-IDF method called term frequency part-of-speech-inverse document frequency (TFPOS-IDF). A t-test was utilized to examine whether the difference in performance between the three methods was statistically significant. The proposed method outperformed the two other methods. The overall accuracy, precision, and recall scored by the proposed method were significantly higher than those scored by the traditional TF-IDF and TFPOS-IDF methods. The evaluation results indicate the promising potential of the proposed method, which can be extended to other languages.},

  title={Industry 4.0 and Higher Education: An Evaluation of Barriers Affecting Master’s in Business Administration Enrolments Using a Grey Incidence Analysis},

  abstract={Higher education confers numerous benefits both to the individual and to society, including higher earnings, lower rates of unemployment and government dependency, an increased tax base, and greater civic engagement. Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier “employment difficulties” (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are “lack of entrepreneurship skills” (H11), “high cost” (H10), “longer payback duration” (H1), “10 yr. ROI” (H9), and “lack of data analytic skills” (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them. This paper also contributes to the literature a first-hand, formal study on the prioritization of barriers to international MBA enrolments.},
