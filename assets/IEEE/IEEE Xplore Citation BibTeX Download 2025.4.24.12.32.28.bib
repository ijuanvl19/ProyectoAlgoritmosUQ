  abstract={Decision makers need capabilities to quickly model and effectively assess consequences of actions and reactions in crisis de-escalation environments. The creation and what-if exercising of such models has traditionally had onerous resource requirements. This research demonstrates fast and viable ways to build such models in operational environments. Through social network extraction from texts, network analytics to identify key actors, and then simulation to assess alternative interventions, advisors can support practicing and execution of crisis de-escalation activities. We describe how we used this approach as part of a scenario-driven modeling effort. We demonstrate the strength of moving from data to models and the advantages of data-driven simulation, which allow for iterative refinement. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of this approach and anticipated future work.},

  abstract={Trying to be effective (no matter who exactly and in what field) a person face the problem which inevitably destroys all our attempts to easily get to a desired goal. The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In recent years, technology has grown rapidly and technology usage also increased massively. With the help of technology, pupils started to think and act much smarter. A biometric system consists of a device, a sensor, methods, techniques, etc. To find a match to a person, the system uses his physical features such as iris, palm, fingerprint, face, etc. Computational intelligence (CI) methods are commonly used to create biometric identity and overcome non&#x2010;idealities that are frequent in datasets. Common types include sample augmentation, feature extraction, categorization, indexing, fusion, normalization, and anti&#x2010;spoofing. Computational intelligence plays a vital role in conducting sophisticated nonlinear calculations by developing models from training data in this environment. These methods employ both supervised and unsupervised training procedures. This work presents a review of computational intelligence&#x2010;based biometric recognition methods.</p>},

  abstract={Although, Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become a de-facto standard for design and specification of object oriented systems but its structures being semi-formal in nature have various disadvantages. The UML diagrams lack with defining semantics of the functionality of a system to be developed. Automata theory and formal methods are proved powerful at requirement specification, modeling, design and test case generation. To address and realize the benefits of liking UML, automata and formal methods, our project on "formalization of UML diagrams" is in progress. This paper is continuation of the same project in which behavior diagrams namely use case, activity and state diagrams are selected for critical analysis and possible improvements. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the diagrams are addressed. Finally, a treatment is suggested to link UML diagrams with nondeterministic and parallel finite automata to enhance modeling power of UML for facilitating the software development procedures.},

  title={A system thinking approach for time dependent availability analysis of multi component systems}, 
  year={2010},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={162-167},
  abstract={The focus of this paper is on the time dependent availability modeling and analysis of repairable multi component systems. Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.},

  abstract={Although recent approaches to combine machine learning (ML) enhanced models and adaptive model selections using the built models became popular in many areas, however, there could be crucial pitfalls of built models in terms of 1) feature extraction and importance, 2) unbalanced datasets and 3) different types of ML estimators. In this case study using the ImageNet dataset, we thoroughly investigate the effects and possible pitfalls of features, datasets, and ML estimators for adaptive model selection of CNN inference network models targeting embedded systems. Based on the comprehensive results and analysis, we summarize opportunistic alternatives to minimize the pitfalls in the model building phase using more accurate feature extraction algorithms, various datasets in balance and size, and different types of interpretable (explaining important features) and black-box models.},

  abstract={We propose a new algorithm for the online supervisory control of partially observed discrete event systems. This algorithm is a parallel/distributed version of the online algorithm VLP-PO that we proposed in prior work. The situation under consideration in this paper is that of a system whose structure can be expressed as the shuffle of three state machines G/sub 1/, G/sub 12/, and G/sub 2/ (with disjoint event sets), where G/sub 12/ is to be interpreted as a common interface between the two system components G/sub 1/ and G/sub 2/. The legal language, denoted K, is global, but it can also be expressed as the parallel composition of two languages, K/sup 1//spl par/K/sup 2/, where K/sup i//spl sube/L(G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/), i=1,2. There are two communicating agents that simultaneously run (online) identical versions of the algorithm but on different models and legal languages: agent i, i=1, 2, operates on subsystem G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/ and legal language K/sup i/. We show that this scheme achieves the same behavior as the sequential VLP-PO algorithm, but at a total execution complexity that is significantly lower; this algorithm generates maximal observable and controllable sublanguages of the given legal language K.<>},

This project intends to study the EEG - computer interaction model based on facial expression. A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming-programming by end users with limited or even no formal programming background-is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Conversational Programming, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to help end-users visualize discrepancies between the programs they intended to write and their actual programming results.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been integrated into K-12 curricula globally, and coding has been the main vehicle in CT education. While great effort has been made in exploring cognitive effect of coding, limited has been done in attitudinal aspects. To bridge this gap, this study validated the existing Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS) in Chinese context and use the scale to explore how students perceived coding. Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.},

The research was outlined with the methodology of action research, allowing the evaluation of the use of language at the end of the approach of each content delivered during the research. The presented results refer to the approach of two contents, of the four established for the conclusion of the research. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate a progression in knowledge about programming logic. In this way, it was possible to verify that the use of the Scratch language contributed to the learning of programming logic.},

It is a technique to automatically rank high - visibility channels and videos in YouTube based on the personalized learning topic. To do this, we analyze the relevance of statistics such as views, likes, subscribers, and comments in YouTube, and use the R programming language with the rvest, ggplot2, stringr packages and the Chrome extension called SelectorGadget for direct data crawling. Initial experiments confirmed the possibility of the proposed technique and confirmed the possibility of extension.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) education is spreading all over the world involving all levels of schools. Software and hardware solutions have been designed and developed to introduce CT at school. In this paper, the first trial of coding activities has been realized using Pepper Social Robot. The idea is to allow pupils to program Pepper; the mission is to guide the robot through a path on a grid sketched on the floor to reach a predefined target. A user test was conducted to evaluate the experience of pupils, in terms of effectiveness, engagement, and cognitive workload in a learning coding activity that involves the social robot Pepper. Pupils appreciated the use of the robot which can interact with them, they were very engaged in the activity and improve their knowledge about coding.},

  abstract={Microsoft's Kodu is a visual programming environment for children inspired by robotics rule-based formalism to specify behaviors. The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.},
