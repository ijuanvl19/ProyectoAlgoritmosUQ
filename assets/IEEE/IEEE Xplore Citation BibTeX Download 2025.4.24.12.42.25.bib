  abstract={In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.},

  abstract={Business and data understanding, that aims to identify multiple mining tasks, is the most primary phase in planning a practical data mining project. However, traditional tasks determination problem could only be solved by experienced analysts, which suffers from high communication cost and low efficiency. In this paper, we study the automatic task discovery method following the problem solving theory. First, we establish the concept network (CN) model to represent human knowledge and experience in the problem solving process. Then, we propose and demonstrate the structure of two major mining tasks (clustering and classification) in a CN. Finally, a data mining tasks discovery method (DMTD) is put forward, followed by two analysis subject evaluation algorithms. Experiment results illustrate that the DMTD is able to discover all the potential mining tasks from a predefined concept network, filtered by the important or interesting analysis subjects. Moreover, these tasks defined by the DMTD are proven to be available and valuable by fifty published papers.},

  abstract={Mathematical knowledge is now often presented in a fragmented form. The problem is how to provide not just a sum of knowledge about the individual elements of mathematics, and some holistic system of representations of the world of mathematics. Integral system of ideas about the general properties and regularities of the objective world, a special form of systematization of knowledge is a scientific picture of the world, which is a qualitative generalization and philosophical synthesis of various scientific theories. For mathematical knowledge such a complete system of representations is a mathematical picture of the world. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there is no single point of view on the subject of mathematics, the positions of scientists differ greatly in the ratio of the various components of mathematical knowledge, in particular between discrete and continuous models in mathematics. The purpose of the article is to consider the way of forming an integral mathematical picture of the world. The historical analysis carried out in the article shows that in the history of mathematics there were repeated attempts to disrupt the balance between discrete and continuous models, attempts to reduce mathematics to one of these two types of models. However, in this case it became obvious the destruction of the integrity of the mathematical picture of the world, the need for a new, balanced perspective on the nature of mathematics. This need became especially acute in recent decades due to the growing role and place of discrete sections of mathematics in the context of computerization of society. To solve the problem, the article uses the trinitarian methodology and historical analysis. This methodology is more and more widely used in post-nonclassical outlook recently though sprouts of this thinking arose for a long time. This methodology presupposes the existence of a third element in addition to two binary oppositions, which is necessary for solving the problem of binary contradictions, as a measure of their compromise, as an arbitrator, as a condition for their existence. On the basis of the trinitarian methodology, the article shows that the unity of discrete and continuous models can be provided by the third component - fractal models. Fractality is just as fundamental a structural property of matter as discreteness and continuity. Thus, fractal geometry is not just a new branch of mathematics, it is one of the most important components of the mathematical picture of the world. Thus, with the help of this new scientific direction, it is possible to ensure the unity of discreteness and continuity, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world among the students. Fractality is the fundamental structural property of matter, it is possible to ensure the synergy of discrete and continuous models, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world. The study of fractal geometry helps to increase the motivation to study mathematics, the convergence of learning and research, enhance the aesthetic appeal of mathematics.},

  abstract={Software testing education is important for building qualified testing professionals. To ensure that software testing graduates are ready for real-world challenges, it is necessary to integrate modern tools and technologies into the curriculum. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), their potential use in software engineering has become a focus, but their application in software testing education remains largely unexplored. This study, conducted in the Capstone Project course of a postgraduate software testing program, was carried out over two semesters with two distinct groups of students. A custom-built Travel Application limited to a web platform was used in the first semester. In the second semester, a new set of students worked with an open-source application, offering a larger-scale, multi-platform experience across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Students initially created preparatory testing artifacts manually as a group deliverable. Following this, they were assigned an individual assignment to generate the same artifacts using LLM tools such as ChatGPT 3.5 in the first semester and Microsoft Copilot in the second. This process directly compared manually created artifacts and those generated using LLMs, leveraging AI for faster outputs. After completion, they responded to a set of assigned questions. The students’ responses were assessed using an integrated methodology, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, sentiment analysis to understand emotions, and a thematic approach to extract deeper insights. The findings revealed that while LLMs can assist and augment manual testing efforts, they cannot entirely replace the need for manual testing. By incorporating innovative technology into the curriculum, this study highlights how Generative AI can support active learning, connect theoretical concepts with practical applications, and align educational practices with industry needs.},

  abstract={In our modern era, it has become essential for citizens to possess artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to navigate an AI-driven society. However, there is a current deficiency in students’ AI literacy. In response to this challenge, this article introduced the AI STEM Project Design Framework (AI-STEM PDF) designed specifically for teaching AI in middle schools. The framework, created in adherence to Activity Theory and the principles of STEM environment design, consists of five layers: subject-object analysis layer, project design layer, learning tool layer, project rules layer, and project goals layer. Following the development of the AI-STEM PDF, AI-STEM projects were devised, and a pre-post experimental design study was conducted with 64 middle school students across two schools. The results revealed significant improvements in students’ AI literacy, thus affirming the value of the AI-STEM framework. Ultimately, the AI-STEM PDF has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of AI courses by providing valuable guidance for their instruction, thereby fostering the development of middle school students’ AI literacy.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter deals with ways of evaluating the coupling that exists between disparate antennas that find themselves installed in each other's vicinity on vehicular platforms or indeed any platform. Clarity on a number of subtle ideas from electromagnetic theory greatly facilitates the understanding of the co&#x2010;sited antenna coupling problem. Study of the coupling between platform&#x2010;mounted antennas is in principle the same as studying coupling between the elements in an array antenna. The chapter describes antenna operation, and inter&#x2010;antenna coupling, in the way a full&#x2010;wave computational electromagnetics (CEM) model &#x201c;thinks&#x201d; about it. The rigorous formulations on which full&#x2010;wave CEM models are based argue as follows: the field generated by the impressed sources if all of the antenna structure were to be removed is the incident field and exists in all of space. Separate CEM models are in effect used to set up each of reduced complexity models for the antennas.</p>},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the innovative application of physical laws, specifically Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, as metaphors within the realm of creative computing. By adapting gravitational concepts to measure the semantic “distances” and “attractions” between entities in textual data, we propose a computational model that interprets these relationships through the lens of physical force dynamics. This approach allows us to creatively visualise complex data interactions in a 3D space, where the metaphorical ‘mass’ and ‘distance’ between entities dictate their spatial arrangement based on calculated ‘gravitational’ forces. The core of our methodology involves the adaptation of the gravitational formula. We apply this model to a case study that demonstrates how entities with stronger semantic links are visually closer, creating imaginative and interpretative 3D scenes. This paper not only highlights the utility of physical metaphors in enhancing computational creativity but also opens new avenues for the application of such models in digital media, interactive art, and educational technologies. Further, this methodology can be extended to visualise and interpret health data, providing a novel representation of chronic conditions. By bridging physical theories and computational aesthetics, we provide a fresh perspective on data visualisation and creative computing.},

  abstract={Explicit methods for the solution of fluid flow problems are of considerable interest in supercomputing. These methods parallelize well. The treatment of the boundaries is of particular interest both with respect to the numeric behavior of the solution, and the computational efficiency. We have solved the three-dimensional Euler equations for a twisted channel using second-order, centered difference operators, and a three stage Runge-Kutta method for the integration. Three different fourth-order dissipation operators were studied for numeric stabilization: one positive definite, [8], one positive semidefinite, [3], and one indefinite. The operators only differ in the treatment of the boundary. For computational efficiency all dissipation operators were designed with a constant bandwidth in matrix representation, with the bandwidth determined by the operator in the interior. The positive definite dissipation operator results in a significant growth in entropy close to the channel walls. The other operators maintain constant entropy. Several different implementations of the semidefinite operator obtained through factoring of the operator were also studied. We show the difference both in convergence rate and robustness for the different dissipation operators, and the factorizations of the operator due to Eriksson. For the simulations in this study one of the factorizations of the semidefinite operator required 70 - 90% of the number of iterations required by the positive definite operator. The indefinite operator was sensitive to perturbations in the inflow boundary conditions. The simulations were performed on a 8,192 processor Connection Machine system model CM-2. Full processor utilization was achieved, and a performance of 135 Mflops/s in single precision was obtained. A performance of 1.1 Gflops/s for a fully configured system with 65,536 processors was demonstrated.},

  abstract={Argumentation has been investigated mainly as an abstract formalism. However, when applying argumentation techniques in practice, abstract arguments need to be instantiated through a logic language into structured argumentation frameworks. Although structured argumentation frameworks provide practical use of argumentation, we think that computational arguments could give light to richer structures. In this work, we introduce a new category of computational arguments named M-arguments. M-arguments are not meta-arguments as the name could suggest, they are computational arguments with rich structure. Such a rich structure allows us to represent a large number of computational models of arguments. Further, M-arguments allows us not only to represent the usual structure of arguments, but also to represent relevant information that concerns the dialectic and rhetoric aspects of argumentation.},

  abstract={Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract={Intelligent recommendation plays an important role in the field of intelligent education, among which arithmetic problem recommendation is an important research field. Geometry arithmetic problems are a major category of arithmetic problems which play a crucial role in nurturing students’ spatial perception, logical thinking, and computational skills. This paper proposes a scene-enhanced BERT model for recommending geometry arithmetic problems. Firstly, a multi-layer classification task of geometric knowledge was constructed for fine-tuning the BERT model. Secondly, this BERT model is used to vectorize the problem to be queried and the problem text in the database. Finally, the query questions are matched with questions under the same knowledge points using vector similarity calculations with diversity correction and recommended according to the score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved good efficiency and accuracy in recommending geometric arithmetic problems. Overall, this research offers an effective recommendation approach for the geometry arithmetic problem task, providing valuable insights for intelligent education field and tutoring system.},

  title={Lower bounds on information transfer in distributed computations}, 
  year={1978},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={151-158},
  abstract={We derive a lower bound on the interprocessor information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network configuration. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communication. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations. Traditional measures of computational complexity, such as the number of primitive operations or memory cells required to compute functions, do not form an adequate framework for assessing the complexity of computations carried out in distributed networks. Even in the relatively straightforward situation of memoryless processors arranged in highly structured configurations, Gentleman [4] has demonstrated that data movement, rather than arithmetic operations, can often be the significant factor in the performance of parallel computations. And for the more general kinds of distributed processing, involving arbitrary network configurations and distributed data bases, the situation is correspondingly more complex. This paper addresses the problem of measuring computational complexity in terms of the interprocess communication required when a computation is distributed among a number of processors. More precisely, we model the distributed computation of functions which depend upon large amounts of data by assuming that the data is partitioned into disjoint subsets, and that a processor is assigned to each subset. Each processor (which we can think of as a node in a computational network) computes some values based on its own "local" data, and transmits these values to other processors, which are able to use them in subsequent local comutations. This "compute locally and share information" procedure is repeated over and over until finally some (predetermined) processor outputs the value of the desired function. In measuring the complexity of such computations we will be concerned, not with the individual local computations, but rather with the total information transfer, i.e., the total number of values which must be transmitted between processors. We derive a lower bound on the total information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communicaion. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations.},

  abstract={The observed growth trend of the wireless communications market will drive the development of new wireless systems, including equalizers. Linear equalization is still a relatively low computational demand and easy-to- implement solution that may increase reliability in low data rate devices such as the ones required for IoT systems and wireless sensor networks. However, the relationship between the mean squared error (MSE) and the matrix correlation of the Least Squares (LS) estimation procedure, with the bit error rate (BER) of the system, has not been fully investigated. This paper presents a description of the simulated BER behavior, caused by the influence of the matrix correlation and MSE, through a causal analysis derived from a systems thinking approach. Then, it is proposed a descriptive hypothesis of the main cause and effect relationships involved in the generation of the BER behavior, using different training sequences in the LS optimization procedure.},

  abstract={In this paper a brief survey is provided on a novel approach to adaptive nonlinear control developed at Budapest Tech in the past few years. Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The already achieved results are exemplified via simulation, and the possible directions of the future research are briefly outlined, too.},

  abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has recently shown good performance in solving large-scale sensing tasks. As an essential topic in MCS, recommending tasks to participants has received extensive attention from researchers. Most studies assume that participants are absolutely rational, which is unrealistic because it is difficult for participants to know all the information about the transaction. Furthermore, most of them do not consider how to learn the preferences of new participants. In addition, their works are difficult to extend to different MCS scenarios. Considering the above problems, we propose an extensible bounded rationality-based task recommendation scheme (EBRTR), which contains a task recommendation framework and a bounded rationality decision-making model. First, a task recommendation framework that can be easily extended to various MCS scenarios is designed. Second, in our bounded rationality decision-making model, for participants with historical task information, according to the implicit information in their historical tasks, the human thinking mode with bounded rationality is simulated, and the improved classification and regression tree (ICART) algorithm is designed to construct the decision tree. For participants who newly join the platform, social information is introduced to construct an initial decision tree. Finally, extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={The transition from traditional pedagogy to self-learning represents a significant shift in educational practice, propelled by technological advancements and the evolving needs of learners. This study explores the evolution from ancient Gurukul systems to modern digital learning platforms, incorporating data from student survey responses. The analysis reveals a marked preference for hybrid learning models (62.4%) and the widespread use of online resources among participants (91%). Supported by established learning theories and quantitative analysis, the findings indicate that self-learning enhances critical thinking, adaptability, and lifelong learning competencies. The results suggest a future where technology-integrated, personalised learning complements conventional classroom instruction, fostering more independent and proficient learners.},

  abstract={The thrust of this article is this: There is a need now, more than ever before, for men to stretch their capacities in what we shall call evolutionary skills. Moreover, it is at last becoming possible technologically to enhance these skills in man by incorporating somewhat similar evolutionary skills in the machines which we design and build. However, if engineers are to develop machines with evolutionary capabilities, they will need to restructure their own way of thinking, throw out traditional ways of thinking, and find their way, through playing with evolutionary design techniques, into an ever-deepening understanding of the significance of such techniques. They must bootstrap themselves into a new kind of ``think,'' into a new climate of man-machine interaction, in which men evolve intelligent machines and intelligent machines evolve men. This new kind of think is what this article tries to unfold in an effort to spur lively support for the evolutionary direction.},

  abstract={The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.},

  abstract={Critical thinking and problem solving are fundamental skills to function successfully particularly in today's world. When programming, these skills are promoted, developed and deployed. In this context, Universidad ORT Uruguay and The University of Edinburgh co-created in 2015 a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that teaches young teenagers how to program. The course was implemented simultaneously in 2 versions: in Spanish, called “¡A Programar!” and in English, called “Code Yourself!”, which are available on the Coursera platform. Since its launch in March 2015, more than 139,000 people from 197 countries have registered. Initially it was offered in a “fixed session”; while currently it is offered in an “auto-cohort” mode. In both cases, students' surveys indicate that the course has met or exceeded expectations (values above 93%). In this paper, we detail the characteristics of the MOOC, and we analyze and compare the modes and results.},

  year={2020},
  volume={28},

  pages={1851-1863},
  abstract={Decision makers (DMs) have different cognitive levels in practical experience, information reserve, and thinking ability. Thus, decision information is often not completely reliable. As a tool that can effectively represent information reliability, Z-number has been studied by many scholars in recent years. Current research on Z-number assumes that differences in various parts of a Z-number can complement one another. However, in many cases, the preference of DMs for each part is difficult to determine, or DMs believe that the differences in various parts cannot be complementary. Therefore, to solve such decision problems, this paper attempts to extend the traditional MABAC method to the Z-information environment by introducing the directed distance and regret theory. The proposed method simultaneously considers the randomness and fuzziness of Z-number. An example about regional circular economy development program selection is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can solve complex decision problems rationally and effectively, and it has broad application prospects.},

  abstract={We introduce hi-trees, a new visual representation for hierarchical data in which, depending on the kind of parent node, the child relationship is represented using either containment or links. We give a drawing convention for hi-trees based on the standard layered drawing convention for rooted trees, then show how to extend standard bottom-up tree layout algorithms to draw hi-trees in this convention. We also explore a number of other more compact layout styles for layout of larger hi-trees and give algorithms for computing these. Finally, we describe two applications of hi-trees: argument mapping and business decision support.},

  abstract={This research tries to construct a new architecture of intelligent information processing imitating that of human thought and having ability of autonomous learning. Its processing is divided into logical and intuitive processing, which are selected flexibly and properly for the changing situation. To investigate its effectiveness, it is applied to a robot playing a Tetris game, which is regarded as a symbol of human intellectual behavior. The robot consists of three elements: recognition part, thinking part, and action part. The thinking part consists of logical and intuitive processing. Logical processing has the ability of accurate and slow processing, and intuitive processing has the ability of rough and quick processing. The learning method of logical processing consists of fuzzy Q-learning with neural network and intuitive processing consists of neural network, which is trained by empirical knowledge of logical processing. The combination of logical and intuitive processing leads to the improvement of game playing results for the reason that intuitive and logical processing built along with playing time becomes more applicable. As a result, it is shown that the proposed method is a useful approach.},

  abstract={Minecraft is one of the most popular games among youth today, experiencing sales over 100 million worldwide and channels on YouTube generating over 47 billion views. Our interest in the game environment is due to its innate computational mechanics that integrate logic, design, and scripting elements. Because of these traits, many organizations and schools are looking to incorporate Minecraft into their curriculum to support computational thinking and computational practices. However, there are challenges surrounding the distribution and availability of individuals who possess the technical and computational expertise needed to support these opportunities. In this poster we introduce the DYN Minecraft Server project. The project is designed to address barriers of entry for adults at schools and youth-serving organizations who want to provide computing-related learning opportunities to diverse youth. We worked with families, city organizations, mentors, and youth to modify the commercially available Minecraft to support adults who may have limited expertise in computing or Minecraft, yet wish to use the platform in order to teach computational content The modifications include the integration of an information network that promotes STEM learning opportunities that are available throughout the city. We discuss our design process, designed activities and interfaces, and feedback from youth, partners, and mentors using the system.},
