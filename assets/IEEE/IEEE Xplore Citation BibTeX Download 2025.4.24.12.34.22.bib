  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) network will shift its focus to supporting everything including various machine-type devices (MTDs) in an every-one-centric manner. To ubiquitously cover the MTDs working in rural and disastrous areas, satellite communications become indispensable, while mobile edge computing (MEC) also plays an increasingly crucial role. Their sophisticated integration enables wide-area edge intelligence which promises to facilitate globally-distributed customized services. In this article, we present typical use cases of integrated satellite-MEC networks and discuss the main challenges therein. Inspired by the protein structure and the systematic engineering methodology, we propose three minimal integrating structures, based on which a complex integrated satellite-MEC network can be treated as their extension and combination. We discuss the unique characteristics and key problems of each minimal structure. Accordingly, we establish an on-demand network orchestration framework to enrich the hierarchy of network management, which further leads to a process-oriented network optimization method. On that basis, a case study is utilized to showcase the benefits of on-demand network orchestration and process-oriented network optimization. Finally, we outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure, and greener integrated network.},

  pages={545-550},
  abstract={Reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) system has emerged as a promising avenue to achieve high communication performance while adapting to versatile commercial wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to optimally program a reconfigurable RF system in order to achieve maximum performance and/or minimum power. Our key idea is to adopt an equation-based optimization method that relies on general-purpose, non-convex polynomial performance models to determine the optimal configurations of all tunable circuit blocks. Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification. A reconfigurable RF front-end example designed for WLAN 802.11g demonstrates that the proposed method successfully finds the globally optimal configuration, while other traditional techniques often converge to local optima.},

  abstract={An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-and-see") and active ("here-and-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples.},

  abstract={The abnormal pause or rate reduction in breathing is known as the sleep-apnea hypopnea syndrome and affects the quality of sleep of an individual. A novel method for the detection of sleep apnea events (pause in breathing) from peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals obtained from wearable devices is discussed in this paper. The paper details an apnea detection algorithm of a very high resolution on a per-second basis for which a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network- which we termed SomnNET- is developed. This network exhibits an accuracy of 97.08% and outperforms several lower resolution state-of-the-art apnea detection methods. The feasibility of model pruning and binarization to reduce the computational complexity is explored. The pruned network with 80% sparsity exhibited an accuracy of 89.75%, and the binarized network exhibited an accuracy of 68.22%. The performance of the proposed networks is compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  pages={208-218},
  abstract={Wise healthcare is a typical application of wireless sensor network (WSN), which uses sensors to monitor the physiological state of nursing targets and locate their position in case of an emergency situation. The location of targets need to be determined and reported to the control center, and this leads to the localization problem. While localization in healthcare field demands high accuracy and regional adaptability, the information processing mechanism of human thinking has been introduced, which includes knowledge accumulation, knowledge fusion and knowledge expansion. Furthermore, a fuzzy decision based localization approach is proposed. Received signal strength (RSS) at references points are obtained and processed as position relationship indicators, using fuzzy set theory in the knowledge accumulation stage; after that, optimize degree of membership corresponding to each anchor nodes in different environments during knowledge fusion; the matching degree of reference points is further calculated and sorted in decision-making, and the coordinates of several points with the highest matching degree are utilized to estimate the location of unknown nodes while knowledge expansion. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm get better accuracy performance compared to several traditional algorithms under different typical occasions.},

  abstract={Puzzles have long history and have been developed by many people. Nowadays computers are contributing very much to the evolution of puzzles. First computers were used to make arithmetical puzzles, like 'arithmetical restoration' or 'crypt-arithmetic,' then to make mechanical puzzles, like 'burr puzzles' or 'polyomino puzzles' and to make pencil and paper puzzles like 'sudoku.' So now puzzle creators of all genres use computers and they can make more beautiful puzzles with computers than before. Computers changed not only puzzle creators, but also puzzle solvers. Now many puzzle solvers are also computer programmers, and they enjoy puzzles by finding the way of solving puzzles by computers. Of course humans and computers are different in the way of thinking, so computer-solving isn't usually the intention of puzzle creators. But some puzzles are especially for computer programmers and we can say such are new tendency in the puzzle world.},

  abstract={A quantitative model-based expert system, or QMB for short, is described. A QMB is a rule-based system coupled to an analytic model. The QMBs provide another level of refinement over rule-based systems by giving quantitative answers to problems. He discusses the difficulties associated with the design of a shell for a QMB and proposes the use of a semishell, which assists the knowledge engineers in writing the logic, uncertainty and inference modules of the QMB expert system program. The design and coding of the modules that deal with the numerical data is left to the knowledge engineer. The operation of a QMB having 43 rules is described. A software architecture is presented that can dynamically change its operation. The purpose of the architecture is to produce an expert system that can think more like human beings.<>},

  abstract={The difficulty of grid-enabled application development is one of the obstacles to employ grid as infrastructure of scientific computing. Although there are many projects, especially grid workflow projects, trying to make grid-enabled application development easier and quicker, the process-based application description model adopted by most of the grid-enabled applications still bothers scientists who are usually beginner in programming. In this paper, a data dependency based application description model is proposed, which describes a grid-enabled application via dependency among data items in the application, and much close to the thinking pattern of scientists. Based on this model, a scientific computing oriented grid application description language (SCO-GADL) is proposed, and an engine for supporting its execution is designed and implemented. The extensible plug-in architecture adopted by SCO-GADL and its engine makes them support different grid and non-grid platforms easily. At last, a test shows that grid-enabled scientific applications can be developed easily in SCO-GADL, and executes correctly on the application engine.},

  abstract={In this paper, we analyze how humans can solve problems quickly by the process of solving the problem of convex hull. Then we present the M2M (macro to micro) data structure which maintains a finite set of n points in the plane under insertion and deletion of points in amortized O(1) time per operation and O(n) space usage. In addition, as the insert operation of each point is independent, the algorithm has high parallelism. And because the insert operations will not cause the imbalance of the tree structure, the M2M data structure is dynamic. Moreover, it can be shared by all the algorithms based on M2M model which greatly improves the efficiency when a variety of algorithms work simultaneity, such as in image processing and pattern recognition. In all, the M2M model points out a general pattern for designing high parallel algorithms, an efficient strategy for solving multi-operational problems and a new approach for computer to stimulate the thinking pattern of human beings.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.},

At Arizona State University, the first course taken by computer science majors and a few other majors is CSE 110. CSE110 teaches first year college students basic programming principles using the Java programming language. In order to do well in this course, students need to not only have a background in basic logical thinking, but also need to know basics about using computers along with Internet and file transfer protocol. To address this problem, a CSE110 workshop has been designed for incoming freshmen that have little or no background in computers. This paper defines the content and instruction of this workshop as well as an assessment of its effectiveness. To help ensure that future freshmen are better prepared, software development curriculum materials are being developed for use at the high school level.

  abstract={Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.},

  abstract={In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.},

  abstract={In 2021, the first year of Metaverse, Web3.0 ecosystems emerged as a result of the Internet's de-centralized evolution. In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.},

  abstract={This paper outlines a new kind of degree that has technology at its core, but is transdisciplinary in nature. Rather than students learning knowledge in discrete disciplinary blocks, they are exposed to ideas and practices from a wide variety of disciplines, and use these to create new ways of working that are underpinned by capabilities in computational thinking, complex systems, data and reasoning.},

  abstract={Serious Games (SG) have proved to have instructional benefits and recent developments in formal methodologies and tools support their design, analysis, validation, and assessment. Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in an educational context where adoption and practical use is growing, facilitated by more powerful and affordable VR headsets. Teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and its applied use can be challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of SG, VR, and the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis in the design of a game. The goal is to develop mathematical thinking skills and increase student engagement and retention through the use of gamification in the creation of a highly engaging and pedagogically sound immersive learning experience.},

  abstract={Fostering creativity is paramount for cultivating innovative minds capable of addressing complex challenges. Modern technologies like eXtended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) may nurture grounds supporting creative thinking by providing immersive and manipulable environments. An open research question is how such technologies may best lead to such a possible result. To help move one step closer to an answer, we present a portable XR platform, namely CreAIXR, where objects may be creatively defined and manipulated with AI paradigms. CreAIXR leverages web technologies, XR, and generative AI where creatives are immersed in a composable experience, allowing them to collaborate and customize an immersive environment through XR paradigms and generative AI. We here describe this system along with its validation through experiments carried out with a group of individuals having a background in the field of visual arts.},
